Questions 1–6: Literature Passage
Growing Up Between Cultures

The kitchen table was our battlefield—not dramatic, with raised voices and slammed doors, but in the quiet way cultural expectations wage war on individual identity. My mother set down congee. My father unfolded his newspaper. My grandmother murmured Cantonese to my sister.

"You should eat," my mother said. Not a suggestion.

I was seventeen and vegetarian. I'd announced this last week. My parents received it like terminal illness news—with silent devastation.

"Just a little," my mother tried, pushing the bowl closer. Inside floated chicken pieces, pale and accusatory.

My grandmother spoke rapidly. I caught fragments: wasteful, disrespectful, American. That last word she spat like something rotten.

Years later, I would learn identity isn't choosing between cultures—it's negotiating between them. But at seventeen, I only knew I was hungry for something I couldn't name.

The passage primarily explores

A) how family meals can become sites of generational conflict over dietary choices and food preferences
B) the tension between individual identity formation and inherited cultural expectations
C) the nutritional and ethical advantages of vegetarian dietary practices compared to traditional eating habits
D) communication challenges that arise when multiple languages coexist within families and create misunderstandings

The comparison to "terminal illness" suggests the parents viewed the narrator's vegetarianism as

A) a temporary condition that would likely resolve itself naturally over time
B) a profound and irreversible loss that fundamentally altered their relationship
C) a potentially contagious behavior that might influence other family members
D) a medical condition requiring professional intervention and therapeutic treatment

As used in the passage, "negotiating" most nearly means

A) arguing
B) trading
C) balancing
D) declining

The grandmother's tone toward the word "American" reveals her

A) interest in understanding unfamiliar cultural practices and their potential benefits
B) resistance to what she perceives as abandonment of traditional values and cultural heritage
C) encouragement of the narrator's independent choices and personal autonomy
D) difficulty comprehending English language nuances and their cultural implications

The narrator's adult perspective differs from the teenage view by recognizing that

A) parental perspectives were generally misguided and lacked validity in most circumstances
B) dietary choices represent relatively minor decisions with limited significance for personal development
C) authentic identity emerges through synthesizing rather than choosing between cultural influences
D) cultural identity requires selecting a single dominant framework and rejecting alternative perspectives

The "hunger" in the final line most strongly represents the narrator's

A) physiological need for sustenance that was being denied by family restrictions
B) yearning for a sense of cultural coherence and authentic self-understanding
C) preference for American cuisine over traditional family foods and cultural practices
D) undiagnosed nutritional deficiency requiring medical attention and dietary intervention


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage
Choice Overload in Consumer Behavior

Psychologist Barry Schwartz challenged a common market assumption: more choice always benefits consumers. His research suggested that excessive choice can cause anxiety and decision paralysis.

His jam study illustrated this idea. In a supermarket, one display offered 6 varieties of jam; another offered 24. The larger display attracted more browsers, but only about 3% of those customers bought jam. At the smaller display, around 30% made a purchase.

Each additional option increases opportunity cost—every choice means rejecting alternatives. This amplifies the potential for regret. With 24 jams available, consumers expect a perfect choice, making a merely good one feel disappointing.

Later, researchers conducted meta-analyses, reviewing about 50 studies on choice overload. They found that its effects occur inconsistently and depend on context. In retirement planning, too many investment options can impair decisions. By contrast, experienced consumers choosing familiar products often welcome more options.

The key distinction lies in complexity and expertise. Novices become overwhelmed, while experts use extensive choices to find precise matches within their established decision-making frameworks.

The passage primarily

A) demonstrates that increased options generally diminish consumer satisfaction across most contexts
B) introduces a theoretical framework and examines research that both validates and contextualizes its applicability
C) provides detailed documentation of experimental procedures used in choice research
D) contends that educational interventions can help resolve many decision-making difficulties

Which part of the passage best supports the answer to the previous question?

A) The description of Schwartz's challenge to a market assumption and his initial theoretical framework
B) The specific percentages reported in the jam study demonstrating purchase behavior differences
C) The explanation that meta-analyses found choice overload only in some contexts and under specific conditions
D) The mention of retirement planning and wine enthusiasts as examples of contextual variation

A bar graph summarizes the jam study with two bars:

one bar labeled "6 jams" showing "30% of shoppers purchased,"

one bar labeled "24 jams" showing "3% of shoppers purchased."

Which conclusion is best supported by this description?

A) Consumer preferences tend to favor specific flavor profiles over others in most cases.
B) Under certain conditions, expanding product variety may paradoxically decrease purchase probability.
C) Retailers might benefit from reducing product diversity in some contexts to optimize sales outcomes.
D) The observed phenomenon appears primarily in jam purchases and may have limited broader relevance.

The meta-analyses revealed that choice overload

A) represents a theoretical construct with limited empirical support in most studies
B) manifests consistently across most consumer decision contexts with few exceptions
C) demonstrates context-dependent effects that emerge under specific conditions
D) operates primarily within financial planning domains and may have limited broader applicability

According to the passage, wine enthusiasts differ from casual drinkers because they

A) typically command greater financial resources for purchasing decisions and can afford premium selections
B) have developed cognitive frameworks enabling effective navigation of extensive choice sets
C) demonstrate reduced decision quality when confronted with multiple options and experience decision paralysis
D) exhibit preferences for constrained selection environments that minimize cognitive effort

As used in the passage, "frameworks" most nearly refers to

A) physical structures
B) wooden frames around pictures
C) organized systems for making decisions
D) building supports in architecture


Questions 13–18: Natural Science Passage
Quantum Entanglement

In 1935, Albert Einstein and colleagues described a thought experiment involving two particles that interact and then separate. Quantum theory predicts that measuring one particle instantly determines the properties of the other—regardless of the distance between them. Einstein called this "spooky action at a distance," believing it conflicted with his theory of relativity.

To avoid this apparent conflict, Einstein proposed the existence of hidden variables that predetermined the particles' properties. Under this view, the particles would already "know" their values before measurement, eliminating any need for instantaneous influence.

In 1964, physicist John Bell formulated a test that could distinguish quantum mechanics from hidden-variable theories. Bell's theorem showed that if hidden variables existed in the way Einstein imagined, certain numerical relationships—now called Bell inequalities—would hold. Quantum mechanics predicted that entangled particles would violate these inequalities.

Experiments from the 1980s through the 2010s repeatedly tested Bell's predictions. The results matched quantum theory and violated Bell's inequalities, ruling out entire classes of hidden-variable explanations.

Yet entanglement does not allow faster-than-light communication. Measuring one particle yields a random result. Only when experimenters later compare both sets of measurements do the correlations appear. Because no one can control the outcomes in advance, no usable information travels faster than light.

As a result, entanglement has become a frontier of modern physics and technology, shaping research into quantum computers and secure communication.

The passage primarily

A) explains quantum entanglement and traces how scientists' understanding of it has evolved
B) argues that Einstein was wrong about everything in physics
C) describes the engineering details of quantum computers
D) proves that faster-than-light communication is now possible

Einstein's phrase "spooky action at a distance" suggests that he

A) accepted explanations involving non-physical or mystical forces operating beyond scientific understanding
B) perceived quantum mechanical predictions as fundamentally incompatible with intuitive understanding
C) embraced quantum theoretical frameworks without skepticism or concern about their implications
D) was the original discoverer of the entanglement phenomenon and its theoretical foundations

Einstein proposed hidden variables in order to

A) introduce arbitrary complexity into otherwise elegant theoretical structures and mathematical models
B) undermine the credibility of competing scientific perspectives and alternative explanations
C) account for observed particle correlations while preserving local causality principles
D) demonstrate fundamental errors in his own relativistic framework and theoretical assumptions

Bell's theorem is significant because it

A) conclusively validated Einstein's hidden variable hypothesis and confirmed his theoretical predictions
B) established an experimental framework for distinguishing between quantum mechanics and local hidden variable models
C) rendered empirical investigation of entanglement phenomena unnecessary by providing complete theoretical understanding
D) served as the direct technological foundation for quantum computing systems and practical applications

According to the passage, entanglement does not violate relativity because

A) no actual causal interaction occurs between the separated particles across space-time
B) the phenomenon operates exclusively within non-relativistic velocity regimes where relativity doesn't apply
C) measurement outcomes exhibit randomness that prevents information transmission and faster-than-light communication
D) relativistic principles have been demonstrated to be fundamentally incorrect and superseded by quantum theory

As used in the final paragraph, "frontier" most nearly means

A) border between two countries
B) wilderness area far from cities
C) cutting-edge area of research and development
D) unexplored territory with no scientific value


Questions 19–24: Humanities Passage
Photography and Memory Construction

When photography was introduced in 1839, some critics worried that it would replace painting. They were both right and wrong. Photography radically transformed visual culture but did not render painting obsolete. Instead, it reshaped how humans construct memory.

Before photography, memory relied on imperfect recall and verbal narrative. Family histories existed mainly in stories, shifting slightly with each telling. The past was fluid, changing as details were forgotten, emphasized, or reinvented.

Photography appeared to freeze moments permanently. Yet photographs construct rather than simply capture reality. Photographers choose subject, framing, lighting, and timing. A carefully posed family portrait from 1880 shows a staged performance, not the full texture of daily life.

Critic Roland Barthes argued that photographs contain both studium—the general cultural meanings anyone can recognize—and punctum, the personal emotional "sting" that pierces a specific viewer. An old photograph of your grandmother moves you not because it records every fact of her youth, but because it makes her distant, mortal past feel tangible.

Digital photography intensifies these tensions. We photograph nearly everything. Social media feeds curate images into highlight reels: vacations, celebrations, and smiling group photos. These deceptive records can suggest lives of constant excitement. Future historians, relying on such archives, might conclude that we attended endless parties and rarely worked, studied, or felt bored. We risk drowning in images while losing sight of what truly mattered.

Yet this raises a question: should memory remain somewhat fluid, emphasizing a few significant moments while allowing trivial ones to fade? Photographing everything preserves vast amounts of data while paradoxically obscuring which experiences were most meaningful.

The passage primarily examines

A) technical developments in camera design and their impact on photographic capabilities
B) how photography has shaped memory and the historical record through selective documentation
C) the ways digital photography is inferior to older methods in preserving authentic experiences
D) the techniques of famous portrait photographers and their artistic contributions

Pre-photographic memory is described as "fluid" mainly because it

A) lacked any reliability or value as a historical record and could not be trusted
B) evolved and transformed through iterative narrative processes and repeated retelling
C) possessed physical properties similar to liquid substances that changed shape over time
D) was stored in aqueous rather than visual formats requiring different preservation methods

The 1880 family portrait is used to show that photographs

A) provide definitive evidence of universal happiness in historical periods and social conditions
B) offer superior authenticity compared to textual narratives and written accounts
C) represent curated representations potentially mistaken for unmediated truth
D) necessitated substantial financial investment in photographic technology and equipment

Barthes's concepts of studium and punctum suggest that photographs contain

A) primarily factual content with minimal interpretive dimensions or emotional significance
B) simultaneously accessible cultural signification and individualized affective resonance
C) purely technical metadata regarding photographic parameters and equipment settings
D) evidence primarily demonstrating photographic technique and expertise of the photographer

According to the passage, digital photography's constant documentation may paradoxically

A) enhance memory precision across all dimensions of human experience and improve recall accuracy
B) increase subjective well-being and life satisfaction universally through comprehensive documentation
C) diminish clarity about meaningful experiences through excessive undifferentiated data accumulation
D) reduce the demand for professional photographic services and diminish the need for specialized expertise

In the sentence "We risk drowning in images while losing sight of what truly mattered," "drowning" most nearly means

A) suffocating in water
B) becoming overwhelmed
C) covering something completely
D) extinguishing a fire


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Universal Basic Income
Passage 1

Universal Basic Income (UBI) proposes giving all citizens regular, unconditional cash payments, aiming to address technological unemployment and poverty simultaneously.

Traditional welfare programs can create perverse incentives. Benefits are often reduced or eliminated when recipients earn income, imposing steep marginal tax rates on the poor. A single mother might lose $800 in assistance by accepting a minimum-wage job, effectively facing an 80% "tax" that discourages work.

UBI respects individual autonomy. Instead of dictating needs through food stamps or housing vouchers, cash allows people to allocate support according to their own circumstances. Struggling artists need different forms of help than laid-off factory workers.

Pilot programs provide encouraging evidence. Finland's trial reported reduced stress and higher life satisfaction without noticeable declines in employment. In Kenya, long-term cash-transfer experiments found that many recipients invested in education, health, and small businesses.

Funding UBI requires political will more than economic impossibility. Consolidating overlapping welfare programs, closing corporate tax loopholes, and implementing modest wealth taxes could help finance a meaningful basic income.

Passage 2

UBI sounds appealing in an era of rapid automation, but the economics deserve scrutiny. Providing $1,000 per month to every American adult would cost roughly $3 trillion annually—an amount comparable to the entire federal budget.

The claim that we can simply "eliminate welfare bureaucracy" is misleading. Many existing programs provide specialized services that cash alone cannot replace. For example, disabled individuals may need medical care, therapy, and accessibility accommodations—not just money. Children need schooling and support services, not merely their parents' larger bank accounts.

Employment effects are another concern. Pilot programs typically involve small groups who know the payments are temporary. A universal, permanent UBI might create different incentives. If people can survive indefinitely without working, some will choose not to work, reducing total economic output and tax revenue.

There are also cultural consequences to consider. Work does more than generate income; it offers structure, purpose, and social connection. A society with a permanent underclass living only on government payments risks disengagement from productive civic life.

Rather than replacing work, we should focus on creating better jobs, strengthening labor protections, raising minimum wages, and providing universal healthcare and education so that people can participate meaningfully in the economy.

Both passages would most likely agree that

A) UBI is economically impossible under any circumstances and cannot be feasibly implemented
B) technological change affects employment and the structure of work in significant ways
C) the current welfare system already works perfectly and requires no modifications or improvements
D) small pilot programs provide strong evidence about many long-term effects of UBI and offer substantial support

In Passage 1, "perverse incentives" most nearly refers to situations in which

A) benefit recipients demonstrate insufficient motivation for employment and lack work ethic
B) benefit reduction mechanisms create disincentives that discourage labor force participation
C) social welfare expenditures exceed sustainable fiscal thresholds and create budget deficits
D) bureaucratic decision-making processes exhibit systematic inefficiencies and administrative failures

How would the author of Passage 2 most likely respond to Finland's UBI trial mentioned in Passage 1?

A) Accept the findings while emphasizing limitations in generalizing from limited-duration, restricted-scale experiments to universal permanent implementation
B) Reject the existence or validity of the Finnish experimental program and its reported outcomes
C) Conclude that the trial demonstrates complete absence of implementation risks and validates universal adoption
D) Assert that cultural factors have minimal bearing on UBI policy discussions and can be largely ignored

Unlike Passage 1, Passage 2 places particular emphasis on

A) pilot program results from multiple countries and their comparative effectiveness
B) possible tax and funding mechanisms for implementing universal basic income programs
C) the non-economic benefits of employment, such as purpose and social connection
D) international comparisons of poverty rates and their relationship to social welfare policies

Based on Passage 1, how would its author most likely respond to the cultural concerns raised in Passage 2?

A) By conceding that UBI implementation would necessarily produce widespread social disconnection and psychological distress
B) By contending that financial stability might enable engagement with more personally meaningful activities including creative pursuits, caregiving, or vocationally fulfilling work
C) By acknowledging that UBI offers no positive cultural or psychological outcomes
D) By rejecting the notion that employment contributes to psychological well-being or social integration

Which choice best describes the relationship between the two passages?

A) Passage 1 proposes a policy that Passage 2 challenges on economic and social grounds with counterarguments
B) Both passages support UBI but disagree about how to implement it and what methods are most effective
C) Passage 1 presents evidence that Passage 2 fully refutes with contradictory data and analysis
D) Both passages agree on the effectiveness of UBI but differ on its popularity and public acceptance
