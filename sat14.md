SAT PRACTICE TEST 14


SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


Stage Lights


The first time I sat in the auditorium, I was ten years old and hidden in the light booth. My job was simple: press the big green button when the director whispered "Go." I loved being invisible up there, watching everyone onstage glow under the lights I controlled.


Seven years later, I stood on the stage instead, staring out at rows of empty seats. The theater felt different from this side—bigger, louder somehow, even though it was silent. Tomorrow was auditions for the spring play, and my name was already on the list outside the drama room. I had written it there myself, with a pen that shook just enough to smear the ink.


"You don't have to do this," my friend Maya had said at lunch. "You're amazing in the booth. We need you there."


She meant it as a compliment, but it sounded like a warning. Backstage, I knew every cue and every shortcut. Onstage, I didn't even know what to do with my hands. I could imagine the director's raised eyebrow, the other actors' careful smiles, the way people said, "That was…brave," when they didn't want to say "That was terrible."


I walked to the edge of the stage and looked up at the booth. From here, the window was a dark rectangle near the ceiling. For years I had watched people step into the light and become characters: kings, detectives, astronauts. Somehow I had never wondered what it felt like to be the one squinting into the brightness.


I took a breath so deep it almost hurt. My heart hammered in my chest like someone knocking on a door from the inside.


"My name is Rowan," I said softly to the empty seats, trying out the words the way I'd say them at auditions. My voice echoed faintly back to me. "I'll be reading for the role of Alex."


It sounded small, but it was mine. Maybe being seen was terrifying—but hiding felt worse.


The passage primarily focuses on


A) the mechanical challenges and operational complexities involved in managing theatrical lighting systems and technical equipment during performances.


B) a conflict between two friends regarding participation in a school production and disagreements about role assignments and casting choices.


C) a student's process of processing and moving beyond the emotional impact of unsuccessful audition outcomes and learning to cope with rejection.


D) a student with extensive backstage experience making a deliberate choice to step outside their comfort zone and attempt onstage performance despite uncertainty and fear.


Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?


A) "My job was simple: press the big green button when the director whispered 'Go.'"


B) "Tomorrow was auditions for the spring play, and my name was already on the list outside the drama room."


C) "'You're amazing in the booth. We need you there.'"


D) "Maybe being seen was terrifying—but hiding felt worse."


The description "My heart hammered in my chest like someone knocking on a door from the inside" (paragraph 6) primarily emphasizes the narrator's


A) physical fatigue and depletion of energy reserves following extended rehearsal periods and practice sessions.


B) frustration and resentment directed toward the director's choices and decisions regarding the production or casting process.


C) profound anxiety and eager expectation, with physiological responses reflecting the emotional intensity of the approaching audition experience.


D) uncertainty and lack of clarity about the specific timing, location, and procedural details of the audition process.


The first paragraph mainly serves to


A) provide reasons for the narrator's negative feelings toward theatrical activities and explain their aversion to drama programs.


B) establish a comparison between the narrator's previous sense of security and competence in backstage roles and their current apprehension about transitioning to onstage performance.


C) recount the conclusion and final scenes of the spring theatrical production, detailing how the play reaches its resolution.


D) demonstrate that the narrator had no choice but to accept the light booth position and was compelled to work there against their preferences.


Which inference about Rowan is best supported by the passage?


A) Rowan intends to withdraw from the audition process immediately before it occurs, deciding not to participate despite previous commitment.


B) Rowan is afraid of performing but is choosing to audition anyway.


C) Rowan wants to stop helping in the light booth permanently.


D) Rowan is confident and expects to get the lead role easily.


The overall tone of the passage is best described as


A) bitter and resentful.


B) detached and analytical.


C) anxious but quietly hopeful.


D) humorous and carefree.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


Taking a "gap year" between high school and college used to be unusual in the United States. Recently, however, more students have chosen to delay college for a year to work, travel, or complete structured programs abroad. Supporters say this pause can give students time to explore interests, gain maturity, and avoid academic burnout.


Research suggests that many students who take gap years enroll in college later with clearer goals. Some return with new language skills or work experience that connects to their eventual majors. Others report that time away from the classroom helps them appreciate college more once they arrive.


Critics, however, worry that gap years can widen inequality. Structured gap-year programs often cost thousands of dollars, putting them out of reach for students from low-income families. Even unpaid internships or volunteer projects may require students to have savings or parental support. A year without coursework can also make it harder for some students to return to academic routines.


For these reasons, some educators argue that the key question is not whether students take gap years, but what kinds of opportunities are available. Community-based internships, paid service jobs, and local college classes can offer "gap year" benefits without requiring international travel or large fees.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that all students should be required to take gap years.


B) describe potential benefits and concerns associated with gap years.


C) criticize students who go abroad instead of attending college.


D) explain how to apply for specific gap-year programs.


According to the passage, one advantage of taking a gap year is that some students


A) never need to attend college afterward.


B) can avoid choosing a major.


C) return to college with clearer academic or career goals.


D) earn enough money to pay for four years of college.


The passage suggests that one concern about gap years is that they


A) are required for admission to competitive colleges.


B) always delay graduation by many years.


C) may be more accessible to wealthier students.


D) reduce students' chances of academic success.


Which choice best describes the structure of the passage?


A) It introduces a practice, lists reasons to oppose it, and dismisses it entirely.


B) It describes a growing trend, outlines both benefits and drawbacks, and proposes more inclusive options.


C) It tells a personal story about one student's experience and then summarizes it.


D) It presents a set of statistics and then analyzes their reliability.


The author's attitude toward gap years is best described as


A) strongly negative and dismissive.


B) uncritically enthusiastic.


C) balanced, acknowledging both opportunities and challenges.


D) uninterested in whether students take them.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that equity is a concern in discussions about gap years?


A) "Taking a 'gap year' between high school and college used to be unusual in the United States."


B) "Supporters say this pause can give students time to explore interests…"


C) "Research suggests that many students who take gap years enroll in college later with clearer goals."


D) "Structured gap-year programs often cost thousands of dollars, putting them out of reach for students from low-income families."


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


A psychology class investigated how caffeine affects reaction time. Volunteers were divided into four groups. Each group drank a beverage with a different amount of caffeine, then completed a computer test that measured how quickly they pressed a key when a shape appeared on the screen.


The average reaction time for each group is described below:


 • Group 1: 0 mg of caffeine → 320 milliseconds


 • Group 2: 50 mg of caffeine → 280 milliseconds


 • Group 3: 100 mg of caffeine → 250 milliseconds


 • Group 4: 200 mg of caffeine → 245 milliseconds


Based on these results, the class concluded that, in general, more caffeine led to faster reaction times, but the improvement became smaller at higher doses.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that caffeine is unsafe at any dose.


B) describe an experiment exploring how caffeine intake relates to reaction time.


C) compare the effects of caffeine on different types of animals.


D) show that caffeine has no measurable effect on human performance.


Between which two groups is the largest decrease in average reaction time observed?


A) Group 1 and Group 2


B) Group 2 and Group 3


C) Group 1 and Group 3


D) Group 3 and Group 4


Compared with Group 2, Group 3's average reaction time is


A) 30 milliseconds slower.


B) 30 milliseconds faster.


C) 5 milliseconds slower.


D) 5 milliseconds faster.


Which statement is best supported by the data?


A) Every additional 50 mg of caffeine reduces reaction time by exactly 40 milliseconds.


B) Reaction time increases steadily as caffeine dose increases.


C) Higher caffeine doses generally correspond to faster (shorter) reaction times, but the improvement shrinks at higher doses.


D) Caffeine has no clear relationship with reaction time.


If the class added a Group 5 that received 300 mg of caffeine, which prediction is most reasonable based on the pattern in the data?


A) The average reaction time would return to 320 milliseconds.


B) The average reaction time would likely be somewhat shorter than 245 milliseconds, but not dramatically shorter.


C) The average reaction time would be exactly 200 milliseconds.


D) The average reaction time would be impossible to measure.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that extra caffeine becomes less effective at higher doses?


A) "Volunteers were divided into four groups."


B) "Each group drank a beverage with a different amount of caffeine…"


C) "Based on these results, the class concluded that, in general, more caffeine led to faster reaction times, but the improvement became smaller at higher doses."


D) "The average reaction time for each group is described below:"


If the results were graphed with caffeine dose on the horizontal axis and reaction time on the vertical axis, the line of best fit would most likely have


A) a positive slope, because reaction time increased with more caffeine.


B) a negative slope, because reaction time decreased with more caffeine.


C) a slope of zero, because time did not change with caffeine dose.


D) alternating positive and negative segments.


In the context of the passage, the phrase "the improvement became smaller at higher doses" most nearly means that


A) additional caffeine stopped affecting reaction time at all.


B) higher caffeine doses became more expensive.


C) each added amount of caffeine produced a smaller decrease in reaction time.


D) participants refused to drink more caffeine.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages – Smartphones in Class


Passage 1


When teachers say "Take out your phones," our class suddenly becomes alert. Everyone scrambles to scan the QR code for the day's quiz or open the online textbook. I know smartphones are powerful tools—we use them to translate unfamiliar words, take photos of lab setups, and message absent group members.


But most of the time, phones aren't invited; they just sneak in. A notification buzzes during a lecture, someone glances down "for just a second," and suddenly three people around them are checking messages, too. A five-minute explanation about history turns into a five-minute scroll through videos. By the time I look up, I've missed the part where the teacher actually answered the test question I was worried about.


Passage 2


Smartphones have become nearly unavoidable in modern classrooms. Some schools have responded by banning phones entirely during the day, hoping to remove distractions. Others attempt a more flexible approach, using phones for specific tasks—like quick research or digital quizzes—while restricting social media during instruction.


Studies suggest that unstructured phone use can interfere with attention and memory. However, the same devices can support learning when teachers set clear expectations and use phone-based tools intentionally. Rather than asking whether phones are "good" or "bad," schools may need to consider how policies can minimize distractions while still allowing students to benefit from useful features.


Both passages most strongly suggest that


A) smartphones should be banned completely from schools.


B) smartphones make learning impossible in all situations.


C) how smartphones are used in class affects whether they help or harm learning.


D) students should decide their own classroom phone policies.


The central claim of Passage 2 is that


A) phones should never be allowed in classrooms for any reason.


B) thoughtful policies can reduce distraction while still using phones as tools.


C) social media always improves academic performance.


D) phone bans are the only way to improve students' attention.


Compared with the tone of Passage 2, the tone of Passage 1 is more


A) personal and frustrated.


B) formal and detached.


C) optimistic and celebratory.


D) humorous and mocking.


Which sentence from Passage 1 best illustrates the narrator's concern about distraction?


A) "When teachers say 'Take out your phones,' our class suddenly becomes alert."


B) "Everyone scrambles to scan the QR code for the day's quiz…"


C) "A five-minute explanation about history turns into a five-minute scroll through videos."


D) "I know smartphones are powerful tools…"


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) unstructured checking of notifications can interfere with learning.


B) students always use phones responsibly.


C) banning phones guarantees higher test scores.


D) social media should be encouraged during lectures.


In Passage 1, the description of "a five-minute scroll through videos" primarily serves to


A) praise educational video platforms.


B) show that the narrator prefers videos to lectures.


C) give a concrete example of how quickly attention can shift away from class content.


D) prove that teachers should assign less homework.


In Passage 2, the word "distractions" most nearly refers to


A) anything that pulls students' attention away from intended learning tasks.


B) new apps that help students organize homework.


C) announcements about class assignments.


D) reminders for upcoming quizzes.


Which choice best describes the relationship between the two passages?


A) Passage 1 provides a student's example that supports the broader argument in Passage 2 about phone use and distraction.


B) Passage 1 contradicts the research findings mentioned in Passage 2.


C) Passage 2 retells the story described in Passage 1 from the teacher's viewpoint.


D) The passages discuss unrelated issues in education.


On which proposal would the authors most likely disagree?


A) Creating clear guidelines for when phones are allowed


B) Using phones for specific classroom tasks


C) Banning smartphones completely from all classrooms at all times


D) Limiting social media use during lectures


The final sentence of Passage 2 ("Rather than asking whether phones are 'good' or 'bad,' schools may need to consider how policies can minimize distractions while still allowing students to benefit from useful features.") mainly serves to


A) argue that research on smartphones is unnecessary.


B) emphasize a moderate position focused on policy design rather than extreme bans or unlimited use.


C) introduce a new unrelated topic about internet safety.


D) suggest that student opinions should be ignored.
