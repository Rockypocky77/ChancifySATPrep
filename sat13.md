SAT PRACTICE TEST 13


SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


The night before my sister Lena's first science fair, our kitchen looked like a storm had passed through. Cardboard display boards leaned against chairs, glitter clung to the table, and the smell of vinegar from her homemade volcano filled the air.


"You don't have to stay up," Lena said, not looking at me as she taped another label to the board. "It's my project."


"I know," I said, though my notebook lay open next to her, a list of suggestions scribbled in the margins. I'd won first place at the fair the past two years. Teachers still mentioned my solar oven whenever the topic of "strong projects" came up.


Watching Lena struggle with crooked titles and smudged marker lines made me itch to fix everything. I reached for the "Materials" heading and straightened it. "There," I said. "Now it actually lines up."


She frowned. "You already had your turn to impress everyone."


Her words buzzed under my skin like static. I hadn't meant to take over, but I could see every way the project might go wrong: the erupting foam spilling onto the floor, the judges asking questions she hadn't practiced.


Slowly, I pushed my chair back. "Okay," I said. "Show me how you want it." I folded my hands in my lap and tried not to interrupt as she repositioned the headings, rewrote a messy sentence, and added a drawing I never would have thought to include.


By midnight, the volcano still leaned slightly to the left, and the title wasn't perfectly centered. But when Lena stepped back to look at her finished board, her smile made the uneven letters look intentional. For the first time, I wondered when my job had stopped being "win the science fair" and started being "help my sister stand on her own."


The passage primarily focuses on


A) the regulatory structures, award systems, and procedural requirements that govern school science fair competitions and establish evaluation criteria.


B) the potential risks and safety concerns associated with using common household substances in scientific experiments and the importance of proper handling protocols.


C) a student's emotional response to competitive failure and the psychological impact of not achieving expected outcomes in academic competitions.


D) an older sibling's evolving understanding of how to provide meaningful support while respecting a younger sibling's autonomy and allowing them to develop their own capabilities.


Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?


A) "Our kitchen looked like a storm had passed through."


B) "I'd won first place at the fair the past two years."


C) "Her words buzzed under my skin like static."


D) "For the first time, I wondered when my job had stopped being 'win the science fair' and started being 'help my sister stand on her own.'"


The phrase "Her words buzzed under my skin like static" (paragraph 6) mainly suggests that the narrator


A) encountered an unexpected physiological response consistent with an allergic or dermatological reaction to environmental stimuli.


B) found Lena's statement mildly entertaining and responded with lighthearted amusement rather than serious consideration.


C) experienced emotional discomfort and psychological disturbance in response to Lena's words, feeling unsettled by the implications of her comment.


D) quickly dismissed the exchange from memory, failing to retain any significant recollection of the conversation's content or meaning.


Why does the narrator decide to "push [the] chair back" and stop adjusting the board?


A) The display board has achieved optimal quality and requires no further modifications or improvements to meet competition standards.


B) The narrator recognizes that Lena must develop agency and responsibility for her own work rather than relying on external intervention and correction.


C) Competition regulations explicitly prohibit assistance from family members and require that all work be completed independently by the student participant.


D) Physical exhaustion and fatigue prevent the narrator from continuing to provide assistance or make further contributions to the project.


What can be reasonably inferred about the narrator's earlier science fair experiences?


A) The narrator consistently collaborated with partners on all previous projects and never worked independently on competition entries.


B) The narrator has become accustomed to receiving recognition and positive feedback for achieving competitive success and winning awards.


C) The narrator has a history of failing to meet project deadlines and has never successfully completed a science fair entry within the required timeframe.


D) The narrator lacks genuine interest in scientific subjects and would prefer to engage with artistic disciplines instead of scientific inquiry.


The overall tone of the passage is best described as


A) characterized by ironic mockery and contemptuous disregard for the events and people described.


B) marked by hostility and aggressive opposition, expressing strong negative emotions toward the situation or characters.


C) reflecting uncertainty and anxiety, conveying a sense of bewilderment and apprehension about unfolding events.


D) contemplative and reflective, with underlying warmth and care expressed subtly rather than overtly, suggesting deep consideration of relationships and growth.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


In many cities, community gardens occupy narrow strips of land between apartment buildings or along busy streets. At first glance, these spaces may seem insignificant compared with supermarkets or large parks. Yet for residents living in "food deserts"—neighborhoods with limited access to fresh, affordable produce—community gardens can be crucial.


Volunteers plant tomatoes, lettuce, herbs, and fruit trees. Neighbors who might never have spoken to one another share tools, compare recipes, and trade advice about soil and watering. The gardens do not fully replace grocery stores, but they can supplement diets and reduce reliance on highly processed foods.


Community gardens also serve social functions. They provide safe outdoor spaces for children to play and for older adults to exercise and socialize. Some gardens host weekend workshops on composting, cooking, or even basic financial planning, turning small patches of land into multipurpose learning centers.


Still, community gardens are not a complete solution. They require committed volunteers, access to water, and protection from development. Without long-term support, even thriving gardens can disappear when land is sold or city priorities change.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that community gardens should replace all grocery stores.


B) describe the benefits and limitations of community gardens in urban neighborhoods.


C) explain how to start a community garden from scratch.


D) criticize volunteers for not doing enough to solve hunger.


According to the passage, one health-related benefit of community gardens is that they


A) guarantee every resident a free supply of food.


B) remove the need for any supermarkets in the area.


C) can increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables.


D) prevent all forms of pollution.


The passage suggests that community gardens


A) solve every economic problem in a neighborhood.


B) always receive strong, permanent city funding.


C) depend on ongoing resources and support to survive.


D) are more important than schools and libraries.


Which choice best describes the structure of the passage?


A) It introduces a resource, explains its advantages, and then acknowledges its challenges.


B) It presents a historical timeline without offering any commentary.


C) It lists unrelated facts about several different cities.


D) It criticizes a policy and proposes a detailed replacement plan.


The author's attitude toward community gardens is best described as


A) skeptical and dismissive.


B) indifferent and uninterested.


C) supportive but realistic about their limitations.


D) hostile toward volunteers and organizers.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that community gardens help build social connections?


A) "In many cities, community gardens occupy narrow strips of land between apartment buildings or along busy streets."


B) "Neighbors who might never have spoken to one another share tools, compare recipes, and trade advice about soil and watering."


C) "The gardens do not fully replace grocery stores…"


D) "They require committed volunteers, access to water, and protection from development."


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


A biology class investigated how the number of hours of light each day affected the growth of a particular plant species. They divided identical plants into four groups and placed each group under different daily light conditions for three weeks. All other conditions—soil type, water, and temperature—were kept the same.


At the end of the experiment, they measured the average height of the plants in each group:


 • Group 1: 4 hours of light per day → average height 6 cm


 • Group 2: 8 hours of light per day → average height 11 cm


 • Group 3: 12 hours of light per day → average height 15 cm


 • Group 4: 16 hours of light per day → average height 16 cm


From these results, the students concluded that increasing daily light generally increased plant growth, but that the benefit of additional light decreased at higher light levels.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) prove that plants cannot grow in low light.


B) describe an experiment that examined how light exposure affects plant growth.


C) compare the growth of different plant species in a forest.


D) argue that plants should be kept in constant darkness.


Between which two groups is the largest increase in average plant height observed?


A) Group 1 and Group 2


B) Group 2 and Group 3


C) Group 1 and Group 3


D) Group 3 and Group 4


Compared with Group 2, Group 3's average plant height is


A) 4 cm shorter.


B) 4 cm taller.


C) 1 cm taller.


D) 5 cm taller.


Which statement is best supported by the data?


A) Plant height decreases as light exposure increases.


B) Plant height is unaffected by light exposure.


C) More daily light generally leads to taller plants, but the increases become smaller at higher light levels.


D) Every additional 4 hours of light always increases height by exactly 5 cm.


If the class added a Group 5 that received 20 hours of light per day, which prediction is most reasonable based on the pattern in the data?


A) The plants would likely die immediately.


B) The average height might be slightly taller than 16 cm, but not dramatically taller.


C) The average height would return to 6 cm.


D) The average height would exactly double that of Group 1.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that extra light becomes less effective at higher levels?


A) "They divided identical plants into four groups…"


B) "All other conditions—soil type, water, and temperature—were kept the same."


C) "From these results, the students concluded that increasing daily light generally increased plant growth, but that the benefit of additional light decreased at higher light levels."


D) "At the end of the experiment, they measured the average height…"


If the results were graphed with daily light hours on the horizontal axis and average plant height on the vertical axis, the line of best fit would most likely


A) have a negative slope.


B) have a positive slope.


C) be perfectly horizontal.


D) alternate between increasing and decreasing.


In the context of the passage, the word "benefit" most nearly refers to the


A) emotional reaction of the students.


B) increase in plant height resulting from additional light.


C) cost of the equipment used.


D) amount of soil needed.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages – Group Projects


Passage 1


I used to groan whenever a teacher announced a group project. In theory, collaboration sounded fair; in practice, it meant that three of us would scramble to meet the deadline while one person contributed a single slide at midnight. The final grade appeared neatly on everyone's report card, but I could see our uneven efforts in every rushed transition between slides.


This year, my history teacher tried something different. Before we started our project on civil rights movements, she assigned each group member a specific role: researcher, writer, designer, presenter. We had to submit a plan describing who would do what and when. For the first time, I left a group work session without feeling like I carried half the project in my backpack.


Passage 2


Educators frequently assign group projects to mirror the collaborative nature of many workplaces. Yet students' experiences with group work are mixed. Research suggests that poorly structured group tasks can produce "free riders," students who benefit from others' efforts but contribute little themselves.


One way to address this problem is to design projects that require distinct, interlocking responsibilities, rather than vague instructions to "work together." Clear roles make it easier to see whether each member is participating and to provide feedback on both individual and group performance. The goal is not to eliminate group projects but to improve their design so that collaboration supports learning rather than resentment.


Both passages most strongly suggest that


A) group projects should be eliminated from schools.


B) group work is always easier than individual work.


C) the structure of group projects affects how fairly work is shared.


D) teachers should assign random roles without explanation.


The central claim of Passage 2 is that


A) all students dislike group projects.


B) clearly defined roles and responsibilities can make group projects more effective.


C) group projects should always receive individual grades only.


D) group projects accurately measure only social skills.


Compared with the tone of Passage 2, the tone of Passage 1 is more


A) nostalgic and historical.


B) personal and reflective.


C) technical and formal.


D) distant and skeptical.


Which sentence from Passage 2 best supports the idea that unclear expectations can lead to unfair workloads?


A) "Educators frequently assign group projects to mirror the collaborative nature of many workplaces."


B) "Yet students' experiences with group work are mixed."


C) "Research suggests that poorly structured group tasks can produce 'free riders,' students who benefit from others' efforts but contribute little themselves."


D) "The goal is not to eliminate group projects but to improve their design…"


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) group work should never be graded.


B) assigning specific roles can improve how group projects function.


C) students should always choose their own groups without restrictions.


D) teachers should ignore complaints about unfair workloads.


In Passage 1, the description of "one person [who] contributed a single slide at midnight" primarily serves to


A) praise that student's dedication.


B) show that the narrator prefers working at night.


C) illustrate how uneven contributions created frustration in past projects.


D) suggest that the narrator did not understand the assignment.


In Passage 2, the term "free riders" most nearly refers to


A) students who enjoy amusement park rides.


B) students who work without pay.


C) students who always volunteer for extra tasks.


D) students who benefit from group work without contributing equally.


Which choice best describes the relationship between the two passages?


A) Passage 1 provides a personal example that supports the design recommendations in Passage 2.


B) Passage 1 contradicts the idea that group work can ever be improved.


C) Passage 2 summarizes the events described in Passage 1.


D) The passages discuss unrelated issues in education.


On which proposal would the authors of both passages most likely disagree?


A) Giving students clearer roles within groups


B) Providing feedback on both individual and group performance


C) Replacing all group grades with individual grades only


D) Designing group tasks that require interlocking responsibilities


The final sentence of Passage 2 ("The goal is not… resentment.") mainly serves to


A) argue that group projects should be banned.


B) emphasize that better design—not elimination—is the intended solution.


C) introduce a new research study about resentment.


D) suggest that resentment is necessary for learning.


Questions 31–37: Writing – Expression of Ideas
