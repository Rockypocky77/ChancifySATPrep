Questions 1–6: Literature Passage

Leaving Home

The bus ticket felt heavier than paper should. One way. Fifty-three dollars to a city I'd only seen in photographs—buildings stacked like children's blocks, streets busy with strangers.

My mother pressed a folded twenty into my palm at the station. "For emergencies," she said, though we both knew twenty dollars couldn't fix the kind of emergencies I'd face.

The decision wasn't dramatic. No slammed doors or shouted ultimatums. Just slow recognition that I'd outgrown my town of 1,200 souls, where everyone knew my grandfather's mistakes and expected me to repeat them.

Fear lived in my throat like something swallowed wrong. But staying felt worse—like watching a movie you've seen fifty times, knowing every scene, every disappointing ending.

The bus pulled away. My mother became smaller, then vanished. I pressed my forehead against cold glass and thought: This is what growing up means. Choosing your own uncertainty over inherited certainty.

Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage

Workplace Automation Anxiety

Technology doesn't just eliminate jobs—it transforms them. This distinction matters. Automated systems excel at routine, predictable tasks: assembly lines, data entry, basic calculations. They struggle with work requiring judgment, creativity, or complex human interaction.

Consider bank tellers. ATMs were supposed to eliminate them. Instead, banks needed fewer tellers per branch but opened more branches. Tellers shifted from dispensing cash (now automated) to opening accounts, selling services, resolving problems—tasks requiring social intelligence.

Historical patterns offer reassurance. The 1960s introduced mainframe computers that would supposedly end clerical work. Office employment subsequently doubled. Washing machines and dishwashers didn't eliminate domestic labor; they raised cleanliness standards, and people filled liberated time with other work.

Yet this wave differs. Previous automation replaced physical labor; AI threatens cognitive work. Radiologists compete with image-recognition algorithms. Lawyers face software that reviews contracts in seconds. Even creative fields aren't safe—AI generates music, art, and writing.

Optimists argue new categories of work emerge. Someone must design, maintain, and oversee automated systems. The industrial revolution created factory jobs; the information age created programming jobs; the automation age will create jobs we haven't imagined.

Pessimists counter that adjustment periods cause real suffering. Coal miners told "learn to code" face unrealistic transitions. A 52-year-old factory worker can't easily become a data scientist. During adjustment, people struggle.

The solution may involve education reform emphasizing adaptability, social safety nets supporting transitions, and labor policies ensuring prosperity is shared.

7. The central argument of the passage is that automation's effects on employment are

A) universally beneficial and require no policy intervention
B) complex, involving both job transformation and genuine concerns
C) entirely destructive and should be prevented through legislation
D) irrelevant to modern economic discussions

8. The author includes the bank teller example primarily to

A) demonstrate that ATM technology was a commercial failure
B) illustrate how automation can reshape roles rather than eliminate them entirely
C) argue that banking profits have declined due to technology
D) show that teller salaries increased after ATM introduction

9. According to the passage, the current wave of automation differs from previous technological changes because it

A) proceeds at a slower pace than historical innovations
B) primarily affects intellectual and creative work rather than physical labor
C) has proven less effective at improving productivity
D) exclusively impacts manufacturing industries

10. The author's discussion of "optimists about automation" primarily serves to

A) dismiss concerns about technological unemployment as unfounded
B) present the perspective that new work categories historically emerge from technological change
C) argue that all displaced workers can easily transition to new careers
D) suggest that automation should be halted until better policies exist

11. The phrase "learn to code" is presented in the passage as an example of

A) an effective retraining program with proven success
B) advice that underestimates the difficulty of career transitions
C) a necessary skill for modern coal mining operations
D) evidence that workers readily adapt to technological change

12. Based on the passage, which policy approach would the author most likely support?

A) Completely banning automated systems in the workplace
B) Implementing educational and social programs to support workers during transitions
C) Requiring companies to hire more workers regardless of efficiency
D) Eliminating all technology from economic production


Questions 13–18: Natural Science Passage

Microbiome and Human Health

The human body contains trillions of microorganisms—bacteria, viruses, fungi—collectively called the microbiome. These aren't invaders; they're essential partners. Your gut microbiome weighs approximately three pounds and contains more bacterial cells than your body has human cells.

These microbes perform critical functions. They digest fiber humans can't break down, producing short-chain fatty acids that nourish intestinal cells. They synthesize vitamins K and B12. They train immune systems, teaching them to distinguish threats from harmless substances.

Disruption causes problems. Antibiotic use, while saving lives, indiscriminately kills bacteria—beneficial and harmful alike. Studies link antibiotic exposure in infancy to increased asthma, allergies, and obesity risk. The hygiene hypothesis suggests excessive cleanliness in developed nations deprives immune systems of microbial training, contributing to autoimmune diseases.

Research reveals surprising connections. Gut bacteria influence mental health through the gut-brain axis. Certain bacterial strains produce neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. Mice receiving fecal transplants from depressed humans exhibit depressive behaviors.

Therapeutic applications are emerging. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) treats recurrent C. difficile infections with 90% success—far exceeding antibiotics. Researchers are exploring microbiome manipulation for obesity, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease.

However, commercial probiotics often disappoint. Most strains don't colonize permanently, and generic products may not address individual microbiome deficiencies. Future treatments might involve personalized probiotics tailored to individual profiles.

13. The primary purpose of the passage is to

A) warn readers to avoid all bacterial exposure
B) explain the microbiome's functions and its potential medical applications
C) argue that antibiotic medications should be prohibited
D) describe the mechanics of human digestion

14. According to the passage, the microbiome is characterized as "essential" because it

A) causes various diseases requiring medical treatment
B) contributes to vital processes including digestion and immune function
C) simply adds weight to the human body
D) contains potentially harmful viral organisms

15. The hygiene hypothesis, as presented in the passage, suggests that

A) maintaining cleanliness prevents all diseases without exception
B) reduced microbial exposure may impair immune system development
C) hand-washing provides no health benefits
D) industrialized nations have inadequate sanitation standards

16. The author discusses the gut-brain axis primarily to illustrate that

A) the brain directly controls all digestive processes
B) intestinal bacteria may influence psychological states
C) mouse behavior is identical to human behavior
D) depression lacks any biological basis

17. FMT is presented as significant because it

A) remains purely experimental with no clinical applications
B) demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to conventional treatments for certain infections
C) has replaced all other medical interventions
D) is available as an over-the-counter product

18. The passage suggests that current commercial probiotics are limited because they

A) contain dangerous bacterial strains
B) often fail to establish permanent presence and may not address specific individual needs
C) are too expensive for widespread use
D) have been banned by regulatory agencies


Questions 19–24: Humanities Passage

The Evolution of Documentary Film

Early documentaries claimed objectivity. Cameras simply recorded reality, filmmakers insisted. This naive stance ignored fundamental truth: every choice—what to film, when to film, how to edit—constructs narrative.

Robert Flaherty's Nanook of the North (1922) pioneered documentary film while exemplifying its contradictions. Flaherty presented Inuit life as pristine and unchanged, but he staged scenes, asked subjects to use obsolete tools for visual effect, and ignored their rifles and motorboats. The "authentic" portrait was fabrication.

Cinéma vérité emerged in the 1960s, promising genuine observation through lightweight cameras and synchronous sound. Filmmakers became "flies on the wall," minimizing intervention. Yet selecting subjects and editing thousands of hours into ninety minutes still shapes meaning.

Modern documentaries increasingly acknowledge subjectivity. Michael Moore inserts himself into narratives, making his perspective explicit. This honesty—admitting the filmmaker's role—may be more ethical than false objectivity claims.

The digital revolution democratized documentary filmmaking. Smartphones enable anyone to record and distribute footage. Social media became a documentary platform. Yet this accessibility raises questions: Does widespread documentation increase understanding or overwhelm us with competing perspectives?

Some theorists argue documentary's power lies not in objective truth but in presenting compelling perspectives that prompt critical thinking. The goal isn't neutrality—which may be impossible—but honesty about one's position.

19. The central claim of the passage is that documentaries

A) employ specific technical filming methods
B) inherently construct narratives rather than objectively recording reality
C) focus exclusively on Flaherty's biographical achievements
D) chronicle the technological history of camera equipment

20. The discussion of Nanook of the North primarily serves to demonstrate how

A) early documentary filmmakers achieved perfect historical accuracy
B) pioneering documentarians constructed seemingly authentic images through deliberate staging
C) the film precisely documented contemporary Inuit practices
D) 1920s film technology surpassed modern equipment

21. When the passage describes cinéma vérité filmmakers as "flies on the wall," this phrase indicates that they

A) worked with inadequate resources and equipment
B) sought to observe events with minimal interference
C) specialized in filming insect subjects
D) operated without any planning or preparation

22. According to the passage, Michael Moore's approach represents a departure from earlier documentary traditions because he

A) utilizes superior camera technology
B) openly acknowledges his subjective viewpoint within his films
C) maintains claims of complete objectivity
D) refuses to conduct any interviews

23. The author characterizes the digital revolution's impact on documentary as

A) entirely positive without complications
B) expanding access while potentially creating information overload
C) completely negative for the art form
D) negligible to documentary production

24. The passage suggests that documentary's ultimate value may lie in its ability to

A) achieve impossible standards of perfect neutrality
B) offer honest perspectives that encourage viewers to think critically
C) eliminate all forms of bias from visual media
D) provide pure entertainment without educational content


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Space Exploration Funding

Passage 1

Space exploration represents humanity's greatest investment. Every dollar spent returns technological innovation, scientific knowledge, and inspiration.

Consider practical benefits. NASA research produced memory foam, water filtration systems, cordless tools, and improved medical imaging. Satellite technology enables GPS, weather forecasting, and global communications. The economic return is substantial—studies show every NASA dollar generates $7–14 in economic activity.

Scientific returns are immeasurable. Space exploration revealed Earth's fragility, inspiring environmental movements. Studying other planets illuminates our own. Mars missions investigate whether life exists elsewhere—arguably the most profound question humanity can ask.

Critics claim urgent Earth problems deserve priority—poverty, disease, climate change. But space budgets are tiny. NASA receives 0.5% of federal spending. Eliminating space programs wouldn't solve terrestrial problems; we lack political will, not funds.

Space inspires generations. The Apollo program convinced millions to pursue science and engineering. Current missions inspire similar passion. This intellectual capital creates future innovations we can't predict.

Finally, survival may depend on space capability. Asteroid impacts, though rare, pose existential threats. Climate change might eventually require space-based solutions. Developing space technology now provides insurance.

Passage 2

Space exploration is expensive escapism. While billions fund Mars rovers, people lack clean water, healthcare, and education. This represents moral failure.

The $25 billion annual NASA budget could address immediate suffering. It could provide clean water infrastructure for developing nations, fund malaria prevention, or support education programs. These would save lives today—not hypothetically centuries hence.

Technological spinoffs are overstated. Private sector R&D produces innovations without space's expense. Memory foam and cordless tools didn't require moon landings. We could fund targeted research for less.

The "survival" argument is absurd. Asteroid threats are infinitesimal compared to climate change, which space programs worsen through rocket emissions. If we can't maintain Earth—a planet already perfect for human life—we certainly can't terraform Mars.

Space inspiration benefits privileged populations. Poor children don't dream of Mars; they need food, shelter, and education. Let's inspire them by solving terrestrial problems.

Wealthy enthusiasts want space exploration? Private companies now fund missions. Government should prioritize citizens' immediate needs. Space can wait.

25. On which point would the authors of both passages most likely agree?

A) Space exploration requires significant financial resources
B) NASA's budget should be substantially increased
C) Private companies should be prohibited from space activities
D) Asteroid impacts represent humanity's most urgent threat

26. The author of Passage 1 primarily supports space funding by arguing that it

A) provides entertainment value for the general public
B) yields technological, scientific, and inspirational returns that justify the investment
C) maintains established government traditions
D) creates employment opportunities in specific regions

27. The author of Passage 2 frames space exploration funding as

A) a wise long-term investment strategy
B) essential insurance against existential risks
C) a misallocation of resources given pressing humanitarian needs
D) insufficient for achieving meaningful results

28. How would the author of Passage 1 most likely respond to the claim that space budgets could instead solve poverty?

A) By agreeing that space programs should be immediately defunded
B) By arguing that the space budget is too small to solve such problems and that political will, not funding, is lacking
C) By denying that poverty is a genuine problem
D) By proposing to double the space exploration budget

29. A key distinction between the two passages is that Passage 2 emphasizes

A) the technological benefits of space research
B) concerns about species survival
C) moral obligations to address immediate human suffering
D) the scientific value of planetary exploration

30. The relationship between the two passages can best be characterized as

A) both presenting arguments in favor of increased space exploration
B) Passage 1 defending space funding while Passage 2 challenges it on ethical grounds
C) both opposing government involvement in space activities
D) agreement on fundamental issues with minor disagreements about implementation
