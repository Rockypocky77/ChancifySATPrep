Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


New Rooms, Old Walls


When my father remarried, the house didn't grow—but the number of bedrooms somehow did. A week before Lena and her mom moved in, Dad knocked on my door and announced that the "office" was becoming my new room.


"It'll be an upgrade," he said. "More light."


He didn't mention the real reason: my old room, with its purple walls and glow-in-the-dark stars, was closer to his and would make a better bedroom for Lena, his new stepdaughter, who was three years younger than me and liked to talk as if we'd already been friends for years.


The first night in my new room, I lay awake listening to unfamiliar sounds. The hum of Dad's printer. The ticking of the old wall clock that had never bothered me in the hallway but now sounded like it was counting down to something.


Lena knocked softly. "Can't sleep," she whispered. "Too quiet."


I almost told her to go back, that it wasn't my job to fix quiet or anything else. Instead, I shifted over. She climbed onto the bed and stared at the blank ceiling.


"You miss your old room?" she asked.


"Yeah," I said. It surprised me, first, that she'd noticed, and second, that I admitted it.


After a while she said, "I miss my old apartment. But the walls here don't smell like cooking oil." She sounded half relieved, half sad.


We lay there in the dark, two people trying to fit into spaces that weren't built for us, listening to the same relentless clock.


The passage primarily explores the narrator's experience of


A) home improvement initiatives and property enhancement projects that involve physical modifications to living spaces.


B) navigating the emotional and practical adjustments required when family structures change through parental remarriage and the introduction of new household members.


C) disagreements and tensions related to academic responsibilities, homework completion, and educational expectations within the family.


D) economic challenges and financial hardships that create stress and limit resources available to the household.


The father calling the move "an upgrade" suggests


A) his attention is exclusively directed toward practical improvements like enhanced illumination and physical space enhancements without considering other factors.


B) he genuinely lacks awareness of his child's emotional experience and fails to recognize the psychological impact of the transition.


C) he is attempting to present a potentially unsettling or disruptive change in a favorable light, emphasizing positive aspects to minimize negative perceptions.


D) he intends to relocate to a different residence in the near future, making the current move temporary.


The narrator's reaction to Lena at the door ("I almost told her to go back… Instead, I shifted over") reveals


A) unreserved excitement and positive feelings toward Lena, with no reservations or hesitations about their relationship.


B) a complex combination of initial resistance or hesitation alongside emerging willingness to accommodate and connect with Lena.


C) indifference toward Lena

Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


Remote Work, Real Consequences


In 2019, only about 4% of full-time U.S. employees worked primarily from home. By late 2020, during the height of the pandemic, that figure surged above 40%. Even as offices reopened, many companies adopted "hybrid" models, allowing employees to split time between home and office.


Advocates argue that remote work increases productivity and work–life balance. Commuting time disappears, and parents gain flexibility for childcare. Surveys show many workers willing to accept lower pay in exchange for remote options.


However, the benefits are unevenly distributed. High-income, white-collar professionals are more likely to have jobs that can be done remotely. Service workers—nurses, grocery clerks, delivery drivers—cannot take their tasks home. Thus, flexibility becomes a new dimension of inequality.


Companies also face challenges. Mentorship and informal learning often occur through spontaneous conversations in hallways or shared lunch breaks. Junior employees working mostly from home may struggle to build networks or learn unspoken workplace norms. Some managers quietly favor employees they see in person, creating a "proximity bias" that undermines remote workers' advancement.


Still, a full return to pre-pandemic norms seems unlikely. Instead, organizations must redesign processes intentionally: scheduling in-person collaboration days, training managers to evaluate performance by outcomes rather than presence, and ensuring remote employees have equal access to important meetings.


Remote work will not automatically liberate workers or destroy office culture. Its long-term impact depends on how deliberately companies and policymakers address new forms of inequality it creates.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that all workers should be remote


B) describe how remote work creates both opportunities and inequalities


C) explain how to set up a home office


D) prove that offices are obsolete


The author's discussion of service workers (nurses, grocery clerks, delivery drivers) mainly serves to


A) show that remote work benefits everyone equally


B) provide examples of jobs that will soon be automated


C) illustrate that many jobs cannot be done remotely


D) argue that these professions are overpaid


The term "proximity bias" refers to managers


A) preferring employees they interact with in person


B) avoiding eye contact in meetings


C) measuring performance using only written reports


D) disliking video calls


The author suggests mentorship may be harmed because


A) employees refuse to talk to coworkers


B) spontaneous in-person interactions are reduced in remote setups


C) workers dislike mentors


D) companies eliminate all training programs


The statement "Remote work will not automatically liberate workers or destroy office culture" implies that


A) remote work has predictable, uniform effects


B) the impact of remote work depends on how it is structured and managed


C) remote work has no impact on workers


D) offices will vanish entirely


Which strategy does the author recommend to address remote-work inequalities?


A) Requiring employees to move closer to the office


B) Judging performance by hours online


C) Scheduling intentional collaboration days and training managers to focus on outcomes


D) Eliminating all meetings


Questions 13–18: Natural Science Passage


Coral Bleaching by the Numbers


Coral reefs occupy less than 1% of the ocean floor yet support an estimated 25% of marine species. Their brilliant colors come from symbiotic algae living inside coral tissue. When ocean temperatures rise even a few degrees above normal, corals expel these algae, turning ghostly white—a process called bleaching.


Scientists measured coral bleaching in three regions of a single reef system over one unusually warm summer. A text description of their bar graph is as follows:


Region A: 20% of corals bleached


Region B: 45% of corals bleached


Region C: 70% of corals bleached


Water temperature data showed mild warming in Region A, moderate warming in Region B, and the most extreme heat in Region C.


Bleaching does not always mean immediate death. If temperatures fall and algae return, corals can recover. However, repeated bleaching events weaken corals, making them vulnerable to disease and reducing their ability to build reef structures. Over time, this shift transforms diverse reefs into algae-dominated plains with fewer fish and less coastline protection.


Reducing greenhouse-gas emissions remains the most important long-term solution. Locally, protecting water quality and limiting overfishing can improve coral resilience, giving reefs a better chance to survive periodic heat waves.


The passage primarily aims to


A) describe coral reproduction in detail


B) explain coral bleaching and factors affecting reef survival


C) argue that fishing should be banned worldwide


D) compare freshwater and saltwater ecosystems


The relationship between corals and algae is described as


A) parasitic, harming both


B) competitive, with each trying to outgrow the other


C) symbiotic, with both organisms benefiting


D) coincidental, with no real interaction


The described bar graph most strongly supports which statement?


A) Bleaching severity increases as water temperature rises


B) Region A experienced the highest temperatures


C) Water temperature has no effect on bleaching


D) All regions experienced identical bleaching levels


The passage indicates that repeated bleaching events


A) always kill corals immediately


B) weaken corals over time and increase disease risk


C) have no long-term consequences


D) affect only the algae, not the coral animals


In context, the word "resilience" most nearly means


A) resistance and ability to recover from stress


B) complete immunity to all threats


C) rapid growth in size


D) the capacity to move quickly


According to the passage, which combination of actions best supports coral survival?


A) Increasing tourism and fishing


B) Reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and protecting local water quality


C) Cooling oceans by pouring fresh water into them


D) Ignoring global factors and focusing only on tourism revenue


Questions 19–24: Humanities Passage


Translating What Cannot Be Said


When my grandfather recited poems in his first language, I understood nothing but rhythm. The words moved like water over stones—sounds I couldn't hold, meaning I couldn't catch. When I asked him to translate, he always frowned.


"It's not the same," he said. "In your language, it becomes… smaller."


At first I thought this was nostalgia, a kind of patriotic exaggeration. But when I began translating poetry myself, I understood his frustration. Languages do not align word-for-word like tiles on a floor; they overlap like shifting shadows. A single word in one language might require a sentence in another. A metaphor rooted in one culture might feel meaningless—or offensive—in a different context.


The translator stands in a tight space between fidelity and clarity. Too literal, and the poem reads like an instruction manual. Too free, and it becomes the translator's poem, not the original author's. The goal is not to reproduce an identical object, which is impossible, but to recreate an experience: the surprise of an image, the ache of a line break, the way a joke lands half a second late and then blooms into laughter.


My grandfather never approved of my translations. "You made it pretty," he said once, "but you removed the sorrow." Maybe he was right. Or maybe the sorrow just sounded different on my tongue.


The passage primarily discusses


A) how to memorize poetry


B) the challenges and compromises involved in translating poems


C) the history of the narrator's grandfather


D) why one language is superior to another


The comparison "Languages do not align word-for-word like tiles on a floor; they overlap like shifting shadows" suggests that


A) translation is straightforward


B) languages fit together perfectly


C) relationships between languages are imprecise and complex


D) all languages share identical grammar


The phrase "tight space between fidelity and clarity" refers to


A) the small size of dictionaries


B) the translator's struggle to stay true to the original while making sense to new readers


C) printing errors in books


D) physical distance between authors and translators


The author's description of translation as "recreate an experience" implies that


A) exact word-for-word accuracy is less important than capturing the poem's emotional effect


B) translators should change plots and characters


C) translation is impossible and should be abandoned


D) readers cannot enjoy translated works


The grandfather's comment "you removed the sorrow" suggests that he believes


A) the narrator deliberately made the poem happy


B) emotional nuances were lost or altered in translation


C) sorrow cannot exist in poetry


D) the original poem was humorous


Overall, the narrator's attitude toward translation is best described as


A) dismissive and uninterested


B) practical but resentful


C) thoughtful, aware of its limits yet still committed


D) certain that perfect translation is easy


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Online Activism


Passage 1


Social media has transformed activism by lowering barriers to participation. A decade ago, organizing a protest required phone trees, printed flyers, and days of logistics. Now a hashtag can assemble thousands within hours. Online campaigns amplify marginalized voices that traditional media once ignored. When videos of injustice go viral, they force institutions to respond.


Critics dismiss "clicktivism" as shallow, but small actions can scale. Donating five dollars, signing a petition, or sharing an article may seem minimal, yet millions of minimal acts can pressure companies and governments. Hashtag campaigns have led to policy changes, corporate apologies, and the release of wrongfully imprisoned individuals.


Of course, not every online movement succeeds. But dismissing digital activism entirely ignores how powerfully networked communication can challenge the status quo.


Passage 2


Online activism may appear powerful, but its impact is often overstated. Clicking "like" on a post or sharing a hashtag rarely demands sacrifice. Historically, social movements relied on sustained commitment: boycotts, strikes, sit-ins, months or years of physical presence. These actions disrupted systems, not just news feeds.


Algorithms also distort perception. A trending topic can make an issue seem universally important when engagement comes from a relatively small, highly active group. Meanwhile, those most affected by injustice may lack reliable internet access, leaving them underrepresented in digital campaigns.


Online activism is not useless, but it is insufficient. Without offline organizing—building community, forming coalitions, voting, and protesting—hashtags risk becoming temporary performances rather than engines of lasting change.


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) social media has no role in activism


B) some online activism has real-world impact


C) hashtags alone always create permanent change


D) offline organizing is unnecessary


Passage 1 primarily emphasizes


A) dangers of internet use


B) logistical difficulties of protests


C) the ways digital tools can amplify and coordinate activism


D) the superiority of traditional media


Passage 2's main criticism of online activism is that it


A) is illegal in most countries


B) rarely involves the sustained sacrifice needed for structural change


C) costs too much money


D) excludes younger generations


How would Passage 2 most likely respond to Passage 1's claim that "millions of minimal acts can pressure companies and governments"?


A) Agree that minimal acts are always sufficient


B) Argue that without deeper offline engagement, such pressure is often temporary


C) Claim that governments never notice online campaigns


D) Suggest banning all digital petitions


Unlike Passage 2, Passage 1 highlights


A) the risk of algorithms distorting perception


B) historical examples of strikes and boycotts


C) the speed and scale of online organizing


D) limitations of internet access


The relationship between the two passages is best described as


A) presenting opposing perspectives on the effectiveness of online activism


B) discussing unrelated topics


C) completely agreeing about digital activism's value


D) offering identical solutions for improving activism
