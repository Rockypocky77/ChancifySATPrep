SAT PRACTICE TEST 12


SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


Alex stared at the blinking cursor on his laptop screen. His article for the school newspaper was due in an hour, and the title—"Is Our Cafeteria Failing Students?"—felt heavier than any headline he had written before.


As a freshman, he had covered club fund-raisers and pep rallies, stringing together cheerful quotes and photos of students in face paint. No one argued with those stories. But this piece included interviews with classmates who skipped lunch because portions were too small, and with a custodian who quietly admitted that the kitchen ovens sometimes malfunctioned.


"Remember," his journalism teacher had said, tapping the draft with a red pen, "journalism is about informing, not attacking. Are you being fair?"


Alex reread a paragraph describing "careless staff and tasteless meals" and winced. The facts were accurate, but the phrasing sounded like a verdict. He retyped the sentence: "Some students say that inconsistent food quality and equipment issues discourage them from eating school lunches." It felt less satisfying, but more precise.


He paused, fingers hovering above the keyboard. Journalism was supposed to tell the truth, but he couldn't ignore that his words had weight. Tomorrow, hundreds of students—and the cafeteria staff he saw every day—would read them.


The passage primarily explores the narrator's experience of


A) the financial structures and funding mechanisms that support student publications and how resources are allocated for journalistic activities.


B) the historical development of school meal programs and how cafeteria services have evolved over time to meet changing nutritional standards and student needs.


C) the ethical tension between reporting truthfully about institutional problems and recognizing the potential consequences of published words on real individuals and communities.


D) an educator's efforts to suppress student expression and limit journalistic freedom through editorial interference and content restrictions.


Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?


A) "His article for the school newspaper was due in an hour…"


B) "As a freshman, he had covered club fund-raisers and pep rallies…"


C) "The facts were accurate, but the phrasing sounded like a verdict."


D) "Journalism was supposed to tell the truth, but he couldn't ignore that his words had weight."


In the context of the passage, the phrase "his words had weight" most nearly suggests that Alex


A) perceives that his article will receive minimal readership and fails to generate meaningful engagement or interest among the school community.


B) recognizes that his prose employs overly complex language structures that require simplification to improve accessibility and comprehension.


C) comprehends that his published reporting possesses the capacity to influence, impact, or cause consequences for actual individuals, including students and staff members.


D) concerns himself with the physical length of his article and whether it exceeds the spatial constraints and layout limitations of the publication.


The description of Alex's freshman-year articles ("club fund-raisers and pep rallies") primarily serves to


A) demonstrate that he previously lacked engagement with journalistic work and approached reporting with indifference or apathy.


B) establish a comparison between his past coverage of uncontroversial, celebratory events and his present investigation of substantive issues that involve potential criticism and accountability.


C) express disapproval of the school's failure to provide opportunities for covering significant news stories and meaningful journalistic content.


D) suggest that he prefers sports reporting to other topics.


Which inference about Alex is best supported by the passage?


A) He decides to cancel the article to avoid conflict.


B) He wants to report accurately but is unsure how strong his language should be.


C) He believes the cafeteria staff are intentionally harming students.


D) He hopes his article will get the journalism teacher in trouble.


The tone of the passage is best described as


A) triumphant and celebratory.


B) tense and introspective.


C) humorous and carefree.


D) angry and accusatory.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


Public libraries were once defined almost entirely by their shelves. Today, many are filled with far more than books: 3D printers, recording studios, homework help centers, and job-search workshops now share space with quiet reading rooms.


This transformation is not accidental. As more people read on screens and buy books online, libraries risked becoming symbolic rather than useful—admired in theory but rarely visited. In response, librarians surveyed communities, asking what residents needed most. The answers varied: internet access, meeting rooms, safe spaces for children after school.


With limited budgets, libraries cannot provide everything. Still, many have reimagined themselves as flexible public spaces. A single building might host a citizenship class in the morning, resume-writing help in the afternoon, and a poetry slam at night. The shelves remain, but they now anchor a broader mission: offering access to information, tools, and community.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that libraries should eliminate physical books.


B) describe how public libraries are adapting to changing community needs.


C) criticize the decline of reading in modern society.


D) explain how libraries are funded by local governments.


According to the passage, one important way libraries have remained relevant is by


A) shortening their hours of operation.


B) charging higher fees for popular services.


C) adding technology, classes, and events that go beyond traditional book lending.


D) limiting access to residents with existing library cards.


The passage suggests that libraries' budgets


A) are large enough to meet every community request.


B) have no influence on the services libraries can provide.


C) require libraries to make choices about which programs to offer.


D) are determined solely by national surveys.


Which choice best describes the structure of the passage?


A) It introduces a traditional institution, outlines a challenge it faced, and describes how it has responded.


B) It presents a problem but offers no possible solutions.


C) It lists several unrelated facts about public libraries.


D) It explains a scientific study and then critiques its methods.


The author's attitude toward modern libraries is best described as


A) dismissive and critical.


B) strongly opposed to any changes.


C) hopeful, acknowledging both limitations and creativity.


D) indifferent to their future.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that librarians actively sought input before changing services?


A) "Public libraries were once defined almost entirely by their shelves."


B) "In response, librarians surveyed communities, asking what residents needed most."


C) "With limited budgets, libraries cannot provide everything."


D) "The shelves remain, but they now anchor a broader mission…"


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


A group of students investigated how exercise time affects heart rate. They divided volunteers into four groups and had each group walk briskly on a treadmill for a different length of time. Immediately after exercising, they measured each volunteer's heart rate in beats per minute (bpm) and calculated the group averages.


The results can be represented as a bar chart and are described below:


 • Group 1 (0 minutes of exercise): 70 bpm


 • Group 2 (10 minutes of exercise): 95 bpm


 • Group 3 (20 minutes of exercise): 110 bpm


 • Group 4 (30 minutes of exercise): 115 bpm


Based on these data, the students concluded that longer periods of brisk walking generally increased heart rate, but that the amount of increase became smaller at higher exercise times.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that all exercise is dangerous for the heart.


B) describe an experiment that shows how exercise time relates to heart rate.


C) compare walking to running and swimming.


D) prove that only 30 minutes of exercise has any effect on heart rate.


Between which two groups is the largest increase in average heart rate observed?


A) Group 1 and Group 2


B) Group 2 and Group 3


C) Group 1 and Group 3


D) Group 3 and Group 4


Compared with Group 2, Group 3's average heart rate is


A) 15 bpm lower.


B) 15 bpm higher.


C) 5 bpm higher.


D) 5 bpm lower.


The data most strongly support which statement?


A) Heart rate decreases steadily as exercise time increases.


B) Exercise time has no relationship with heart rate.


C) Longer exercise times generally correspond to higher heart rates, though the increases get smaller.


D) Heart rate always increases by exactly 20 bpm for every 10 minutes of exercise.


Suppose the students added a Group 5 that walked briskly for 40 minutes. Based on the pattern in the data, which prediction is most reasonable?


A) The average heart rate would likely be slightly higher than 115 bpm, but not dramatically higher.


B) The average heart rate would drop back to 70 bpm.


C) The average heart rate would exactly double that of Group 1.


D) The average heart rate would be impossible to measure.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that the effect of exercise time becomes smaller at higher durations?


A) "A group of students investigated how exercise time affects heart rate."


B) "They divided volunteers into four groups…"


C) "Based on these data, the students concluded that longer periods of brisk walking generally increased heart rate, but that the amount of increase became smaller at higher exercise times."


D) "Immediately after exercising, they measured each volunteer's heart rate…"


If the results were graphed with exercise time on the horizontal axis and heart rate on the vertical axis, the line of best fit would most likely


A) have a positive slope, because heart rate generally increases with more exercise time.


B) have a negative slope, because heart rate generally decreases with more exercise time.


C) be perfectly horizontal.


D) alternate between positive and negative slopes.


In the context of the passage, the word "effect" in "the effect of exercise time on heart rate" most nearly refers to


A) the cause of the experiment.


B) the appearance of the treadmill.


C) the influence exercise time has on heart rate.


D) the students' opinion about exercise.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages – Group Projects


Passage 1


I used to groan whenever a teacher announced a group project. In theory, collaboration sounded fair; in practice, it meant that three of us would scramble to meet the deadline while one person contributed a single slide at midnight. The final grade appeared neatly on everyone's report card, but I could see our uneven efforts in every rushed transition between slides.


This year, my history teacher tried something different. Before we started our project on civil rights movements, she assigned each group member a specific role: researcher, writer, designer, presenter. We had to submit a plan describing who would do what and when. For the first time, I left a group work session without feeling like I carried half the project in my backpack.


Passage 2


Educators frequently assign group projects to mirror the collaborative nature of many workplaces. Yet students' experiences with group work are mixed. Research suggests that poorly structured group tasks can produce "free riders," students who benefit from others' efforts but contribute little themselves.


One way to address this problem is to design projects that require distinct, interlocking responsibilities, rather than vague instructions to "work together." Clear roles make it easier to see whether each member is participating and to provide feedback on both individual and group performance. The goal is not to eliminate group projects but to improve their design so that collaboration supports learning rather than resentment.


Both passages most strongly suggest that


A) group projects should be eliminated from schools.


B) group work is usually easier than individual work.


C) the structure of group projects affects how fairly work is shared.


D) teachers should assign random roles without explanation.


The central claim of Passage 2 is that


A) all students dislike group projects.


B) clearly designed roles and responsibilities can make group projects more effective.


C) group projects should always be graded individually.


D) group projects accurately measure only social skills.


Compared with the tone of Passage 2, the tone of Passage 1 is more


A) nostalgic and historical.


B) personal and reflective.


C) technical and formal.


D) distant and skeptical.


Which sentence from Passage 2 best supports the idea that unclear expectations lead to unfair workloads?


A) "Educators frequently assign group projects to mirror the collaborative nature of many workplaces."


B) "Yet students' experiences with group work are mixed."


C) "Research suggests that poorly structured group tasks can produce 'free riders,' students who benefit from others' efforts but contribute little themselves."


D) "The goal is not to eliminate group projects but to improve their design…"


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) group work should never be graded.


B) assigning specific roles can improve group project experiences.


C) students should choose whether to work alone or in groups for every assignment.


D) teachers should ignore complaints about unfair workloads.


In Passage 1, the description of "one person [who] contributed a single slide at midnight" primarily serves to


A) praise the group member who stayed up late.


B) show that the narrator prefers working at night.


C) illustrate how uneven contributions created frustration in past group projects.


D) suggest that the narrator did not understand the assignment.


In Passage 2, the term "free riders" most nearly refers to


A) students who enjoy amusement park rides.


B) students who work for free.


C) students who travel to school by bicycle.


D) students who benefit from group work without contributing equally.


Which choice best describes the relationship between the two passages?


A) Passage 1 provides a personal example that supports the design recommendations in Passage 2.


B) Passage 1 contradicts the idea that group work can ever be improved.


C) Passage 2 summarizes the events described in Passage 1.


D) The passages discuss unrelated classroom issues.


On which proposal would the authors most likely disagree?


A) Giving students clearer roles within groups


B) Providing feedback on both individual and group performance


C) Replacing all group grades with individual grades only


D) Designing group tasks that require interlocking responsibilities


The final sentence of Passage 2 ("The goal is not… resentment.") mainly serves to


A) argue that group projects should be banned.


B) emphasize that better design, not removal, is the intended solution.


C) introduce a new research study about resentment.


D) suggest that resentment is necessary for learning.


Questions 31–37: Writing – Expression of Ideas
