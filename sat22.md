SAT PRACTICE TEST 22


SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


The Stage Manager


When the curtain rose, I stood in the wings, invisible to the audience but close enough to feel the heat of the stage lights. The actors glided into their opening positions, faces already transformed into their characters'. I checked the prop table for the fourth time, though I knew every object by heart: the chipped teacup, the fake newspaper, the bouquet that had to fall exactly on cue.


I used to dream of being out there, center stage. In middle school, I auditioned for every production and never got more than three lines. My voice, the director said, didn't "carry," and I had an unfortunate tendency to forget where to stand.


When I finally gave up auditioning, I thought I was giving up theater. Instead, I found the job that quietly runs everything: stage manager. Now my voice does carry—through the headset, calling light cues and scene changes. I know where everyone should stand, down to the tile on the floor.


Tonight, just before the show, the lead actress had stared at me, eyes wide. "What if I forget my monologue?" she whispered.


"You won't," I said, though both of us knew she might. That's why I keep a script on my clipboard, crowded with sticky notes and underlines. If she faltered, I'd whisper the first line into her earpiece, and she'd pull the rest from memory. The audience would never know I'd been there at all.


Out front, the house lights dimmed. I took a breath and spoke into the mic. "Stand by, lights. Stand by, sound." Center stage glittered in the half-dark, waiting for someone else's footsteps—but I stayed where I was, exactly where I belonged.


The passage primarily focuses on the narrator


A) experiencing bitterness and resentment about being denied acting opportunities and feeling personally rejected by the theatrical community.


B) coming to understand that working in a supporting, non-performance capacity aligns better with their skills and provides greater fulfillment.


C) making a definitive decision to completely withdraw from theatrical activities and permanently discontinue involvement in dramatic arts.


D) expressing disapproval of the director's selection processes and challenging the validity of casting decisions made during productions.


Which sentence best supports the answer to Question 1?


A) "I used to dream of being out there, center stage."


B) "My voice, the director said, didn't 'carry.'"


C) "Instead, I found the job that quietly runs everything: stage manager."


D) "The audience would never know I'd been there at all."


The description of the prop table ("chipped teacup… bouquet that had to fall exactly on cue") mainly emphasizes the narrator's


A) meticulous attention to specific elements and commitment to exact timing and placement requirements.


B) negative feelings toward props and stage objects, viewing them as unnecessary complications.


C) apprehension about damaging delicate items and concerns about potential breakage during performances.


D) lack of understanding about the production's requirements and uncertainty about show logistics.


The director's comments about the narrator's voice and blocking suggest that the narrator


A) was not a strong actor onstage.


B) refused to follow instructions.


C) had no interest in learning theater skills.


D) was purposely left out of rehearsals.


The interaction with the lead actress ("What if I forget my monologue?") primarily shows that the narrator


A) enjoys making others nervous.


B) is responsible for supporting the actors during the performance.


C) wishes the actress would fail so they can replace her.


D) plans to cancel the show.


The final sentence suggests that the narrator now feels


A) disappointed by the lack of applause.

C) content with their position offstage.


D) eager to return to acting.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


Public Parks and Urban Health


City planners increasingly recognize that public parks are not just decorative spaces but important components of public health. Parks provide places for exercise, social interaction, and contact with nature—all of which can reduce stress and improve mental well-being. Studies have shown that people who live near green spaces often report lower levels of anxiety and higher overall life satisfaction.


However, access to parks is not evenly distributed. In some neighborhoods, residents enjoy tree-lined paths, sports fields, and playgrounds within walking distance. Other areas, particularly low-income communities, have few or no safe public green spaces. This "park gap" can reinforce existing health disparities.


To address this problem, some cities are converting vacant lots into mini-parks, adding trees along sidewalks, and redesigning schoolyards to include shared green spaces. These projects can be relatively inexpensive compared with building large new parks, yet they still offer meaningful health and social benefits.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that parks should be replaced with housing.


B) explain how public parks contribute to urban health and why access to them matters.


C) describe the history of national parks.


D) criticize people who do not exercise.


According to the passage, one benefit of living near green spaces is that residents


A) automatically earn higher incomes.


B) often report lower anxiety and higher life satisfaction.


C) never visit hospitals.


D) move to rural areas.


The term "park gap" most nearly refers to


A) differences in clothing styles between park visitors.


B) the distance between two large parks.


C) unequal access to safe public green spaces in different neighborhoods.


D) a specific park located between two major roads.


Which sentence best supports the idea that cities can improve access to green spaces without building huge new parks?


A) "City planners increasingly recognize that public parks are not just decorative spaces…"


B) "In some neighborhoods, residents enjoy tree-lined paths, sports fields, and playgrounds…"


C) "Other areas, particularly low-income communities, have few or no safe public green spaces."


D) "Some cities are converting vacant lots into mini-parks, adding trees along sidewalks, and redesigning schoolyards to include shared green spaces."


The passage suggests that unequal access to parks can


A) reduce people's interest in nature documentaries.


B) reinforce existing health disparities among communities.


C) improve air quality for everyone equally.


D) eliminate the need for public transportation.


The author's attitude toward efforts to create mini-parks and green schoolyards is best described as


A) dismissive and skeptical.


B) cautiously supportive, viewing them as useful steps.


C) strongly opposed.


D) indifferent.


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


Running Speed and Oxygen Uptake


A sports scientist studied how running speed affected oxygen uptake in trained athletes. Each athlete ran on a treadmill at four different speeds while the scientist measured the volume of oxygen used per minute. All other conditions remained constant.


The average results are given below:


 • Speed A: 6 kilometers per hour → 25 units of oxygen per minute


 • Speed B: 9 kilometers per hour → 35 units of oxygen per minute


 • Speed C: 12 kilometers per hour → 44 units of oxygen per minute


 • Speed D: 15 kilometers per hour → 50 units of oxygen per minute


Based on these results, the scientist concluded that oxygen uptake increased with speed but that the rate of increase slowed at the highest speed tested.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) describe an experiment linking running speed to oxygen usage.


B) explain how to train for a marathon.


C) compare swimming and running.

Compared with Speed C, Speed D shows


A) equal oxygen uptake.


B) a smaller oxygen uptake.


C) a larger oxygen uptake, but by a smaller amount than the increase between earlier speeds.


D) a dramatic decrease in oxygen uptake.


Which statement is best supported by the data?


A) Oxygen uptake remains constant regardless of speed.


B) Oxygen uptake increases with speed, but the increases become smaller at higher speeds.


C) Oxygen uptake decreases as speed increases.


D) Oxygen uptake is highest at the lowest speed.


If the scientist added a Speed E at 18 kilometers per hour, which prediction would be most consistent with the pattern?


A) Oxygen uptake would be much lower than at Speed A.


B) Oxygen uptake would increase slightly compared with Speed D, but by less than 5 units.


C) Oxygen uptake would drop to 25 units.


D) Oxygen uptake would double compared with Speed C.


Which sentence from the passage most directly states the scientist's conclusion?

C) a measure of how much oxygen an athlete's body uses per minute.


D) the speed at which the treadmill moves.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages – E-Books and Print Books


Passage 1


E-books have reshaped how many readers access written stories and information.
