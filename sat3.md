SAT PRACTICE TEST 3

SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)

---

**Question 1**

Maya found the letter tucked inside her grandmother's Bible, yellowed and fragile as autumn leaves. The handwriting was unfamiliar—looping, elegant, distinctly masculine. "My dearest Rosalie," it began. The letter was dated 1952, two years before her grandmother married Grandfather James. The writer spoke of stolen afternoons, of promises that read like prayers. He signed it "Forever yours, Thomas." Maya had never heard of Thomas. She knew her grandparents' story: childhood sweethearts, married at nineteen, sixty-three years together. Here was evidence of another story.

The passage primarily explores

A) the historical evolution of letter-writing traditions and correspondence practices
B) how unexpected discoveries can challenge established family narratives and assumptions
C) quality standards for long-term care facilities and nursing home services
D) interpretive methods for analyzing religious texts and biblical scholarship

---

**Question 2**

The letter was yellowed and fragile as autumn leaves, tucked inside her grandmother's Bible where it had remained hidden for decades. The paper crinkled at Maya's touch, threatening to tear along fold lines pressed and repressed over seventy years. Whatever its contents revealed, the letter itself testified to time's passage—an artifact from an era when people committed their deepest feelings to paper and trusted the post office with their hearts.

The description of the letter as "yellowed and fragile as autumn leaves" primarily suggests

A) the document is a recent fabrication created to deceive family members
B) the letter has aged significantly, emphasizing its connection to the distant past
C) the grandmother had negative associations with autumn and seasonal change
D) historical letters were written on leaves rather than manufactured paper

---

**Question 3**

The letter was dated 1952, two years before her grandmother married Grandfather James. The writer spoke of stolen afternoons, of a future they'd planned together, of promises that read like prayers. He signed it "Forever yours, Thomas." Maya had never heard of Thomas. In all her grandmother's stories about youth in small-town Texas, Thomas never appeared—yet here was evidence of intense romantic connection, passion strong enough to inspire such language.

Thomas's letter reveals that he and Rose

A) maintained professional business relationships in their respective careers
B) shared romantic involvement before Rose's marriage to James
C) were biological siblings separated during childhood
D) attended the grandmother's funeral together recently

---

**Question 4**

Maya knew her grandparents' story: childhood sweethearts, married at nineteen, sixty-three years together until Grandfather's death last spring. It was the kind of love story people tell at eulogies—simple, enduring, complete. Yet here was Thomas, evidence of another story. Another love. Another life that might have been. The family narrative suddenly seemed like an edited version, omitting chapters that complicated its satisfying arc.

Maya's prior knowledge of her grandparents as "childhood sweethearts" is significant because it

A) confirms everything Thomas wrote in his letter as accurate
B) creates tension with the letter's revelation of another romantic relationship
C) proves Thomas's letter must be fabricated or mistakenly addressed
D) establishes patterns that define all romantic relationships universally

---

**Question 5**

Maya thought of her grandmother in the nursing home those final months, sometimes confused, sometimes lucid. Once, she'd gripped Maya's hand with surprising strength and said, "I made the right choice. Remember that." Maya had assumed she meant something medical—refusing aggressive treatment, accepting hospice care. Now, with Thomas's letter in her hands, the words carried different possible meanings entirely.

The grandmother's statement "I made the right choice" most likely refers to

A) her decision regarding medical treatment options near life's end
B) choosing to marry James rather than pursuing a relationship with Thomas
C) selecting which religious text to keep at her bedside
D) deciding to move into the nursing facility rather than staying home

---

**Question 6**

She could ask her mother. She could investigate, unearth whatever secrets her grandmother had buried alongside this letter. Or she could return it to the Bible, let the past remain undisturbed. Maya folded the letter carefully and slid it back between the tissue-thin pages of Genesis. Some stories, perhaps, were meant to remain untold—their significance lying not in revelation but in the simple fact of their existence.

Maya's decision to return the letter to the Bible suggests she

A) has no genuine interest in her grandmother's life or legacy
B) chooses to respect certain secrets rather than pursuing full disclosure
C) plans to destroy the Bible and its contents through burning
D) cannot read the handwriting and therefore finds the letter meaningless

---

**Question 7**

American education emphasizes choice: charter schools, magnet programs, open enrollment, homeschooling options. The assumption is that more options improve outcomes by allowing families to find the best fit for each child. Research complicates this assumption. Studies in cities with extensive school choice find modest academic improvements at best, and these gains often come at the cost of increased segregation. When families choose schools, they frequently select based on demographics rather than educational quality.

The passage suggests that research on school choice has found

A) dramatic and consistent improvements in academic outcomes across all populations
B) modest academic gains often accompanied by increased segregation effects
C) no measurable effects of any kind on educational outcomes
D) that choice exclusively benefits students from disadvantaged backgrounds

---

**Question 8**

Information asymmetries compound problems with school choice. Wealthy, educated parents research school performance data, visit campuses, and network with other parents. Lower-income families often lack time, transportation, and access to navigate complex choice systems. "Choice" becomes meaningful only for those with resources to exercise it effectively—the very families who already have educational advantages.

According to the passage, "information asymmetries" in school choice refer to

A) schools providing inaccurate data about their performance to prospective families
B) unequal access to the information and resources needed to make informed choices
C) parents having more information than schools about student needs
D) government agencies concealing educational data from public access

---

**Question 9**

Some argue choice creates healthy competition, forcing schools to improve or lose students. Yet schools serving disadvantaged populations face challenges—higher special education needs, more English learners, greater poverty impacts—that make direct comparison unfair. A school might be doing excellent work with struggling students while appearing inferior on standardized metrics compared to schools serving privileged populations.

The passage suggests that comparing schools serving different populations is problematic because

A) all schools have identical resources and face identical challenges
B) schools serving disadvantaged students face challenges that affect standardized metrics
C) standardized testing has been universally abandoned as an assessment tool
D) only schools serving wealthy populations achieve meaningful academic outcomes

---

**Question 10**

The deeper question is whether market logic belongs in education at all. Markets work well for commodities where informed consumers can evaluate quality directly. Education involves long-term, complex outcomes difficult for any individual to assess in advance. A parent choosing a kindergarten cannot evaluate whether that choice will affect college readiness thirteen years later—the feedback loop is simply too long for market mechanisms to function effectively.

The passage questions market logic in education primarily because

A) educational outcomes are too complex and long-term for consumers to evaluate effectively
B) parents universally lack the intelligence to make educational decisions
C) markets have never functioned successfully in any sector of the economy
D) all schools provide identical educational experiences regardless of choice

Perhaps the focus on choice distracts from ensuring all schools provide excellent education. Rather than helping some families escape struggling schools, we might invest in making every school worth choosing.

The passage primarily argues that

A) educational choice mechanisms generally enhance learning outcomes across most contexts
B) school choice generates multifaceted consequences that may disproportionately benefit certain demographic groups
C) all educational institutions demonstrate equivalent quality and effectiveness
D) parental engagement in educational decision-making lacks significance

According to the passage, school choice sometimes increases segregation because

A) educational institutions engage in deliberate discriminatory practices and exclusionary policies
B) families frequently prioritize demographic factors over academic quality when selecting schools
C) transportation infrastructure prevents access to preferred institutions and creates barriers
D) all schools demonstrate equivalent educational effectiveness and provide identical opportunities

"Information asymmetries" in school choice means

A) educational institutions deliberately conceal relevant data from families and restrict transparency
B) families with greater socioeconomic resources possess superior information access for decision-making
C) all families have equivalent access to information necessary for school selection and decision processes
D) information availability has no bearing on educational choice outcomes and decision quality

The passage suggests that comparing schools serving different populations is problematic because

A) all educational institutions demonstrate identical characteristics and outcomes without variation
B) schools encounter distinct challenges reflecting the specific needs and circumstances of their student populations
C) comparative analysis rarely provides meaningful insights into educational quality or effectiveness
D) standardized assessment instruments are unavailable for evaluation purposes and cannot be used

The author questions applying "market logic" to education because

A) market mechanisms tend to produce systemic failures in many contexts and often fail
B) educational outcomes involve intricate long-term processes that resist immediate assessment
C) parents demonstrate insufficient concern for their children's welfare and neglect responsibilities
D) competitive dynamics have no legitimate role in educational systems and should be eliminated

The final paragraph suggests the author favors

A) complete elimination of formal educational institutions
B) enhancing educational quality broadly rather than facilitating selective exit from underperforming schools
C) expanding the range of available educational options and alternatives
D) transferring all educational provision to private sector entities


Questions 13–18: Natural Science Passage
The Microbiome and Human Health

The human body hosts trillions of microorganisms—bacteria, viruses, fungi—collectively called the microbiome. Far from being merely passengers or parasites, these microbes perform essential functions affecting digestion, immunity, and even brain function.

The gut microbiome alone contains hundreds of bacterial species. These bacteria break down fiber humans cannot digest, producing short-chain fatty acids that nourish intestinal cells. They synthesize vitamins, including B12 and K. They train the immune system, helping it distinguish between harmful pathogens and benign substances.

Research increasingly links microbiome composition to health outcomes. People with inflammatory bowel disease show reduced microbial diversity. Obesity correlates with altered bacterial ratios. Some studies suggest microbiome differences may influence conditions from allergies to depression.

The mechanisms remain partly mysterious. The gut-brain axis—communication between intestinal bacteria and the central nervous system—appears to involve neural pathways, immune signaling, and bacterial metabolites. Exactly how bacteria in the intestine might affect mood or cognition is still being investigated.

Modern life may be disrupting healthy microbiomes. Antibiotics kill beneficial bacteria alongside pathogens. Highly processed diets provide less fiber that feeds beneficial species. Reduced contact with diverse environmental microbes—the "hygiene hypothesis"—may impair immune development.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) demonstrates the microbiome's importance. For patients with recurrent C. difficile infections—a potentially deadly intestinal disease—transplanting stool from healthy donors restores microbial balance with remarkable success rates exceeding 90%.

The microbiome represents a frontier of medicine. We're only beginning to understand how the bacteria we host shape our health.

The passage primarily

A) argues against all bacteria
B) explains the microbiome's roles and its emerging importance in medicine
C) describes one specific disease
D) promotes probiotic supplements

According to the passage, gut bacteria help digestion by

A) attacking food directly
B) breaking down fiber and producing vitamins
C) eliminating all other bacteria
D) bypassing the intestine

The gut-brain axis refers to

A) a type of bacteria
B) communication between intestinal bacteria and the nervous system
C) brain surgery
D) dietary choices

The "hygiene hypothesis" suggests that

A) cleanliness is unimportant
B) reduced exposure to diverse microbes may impair immune development
C) hygiene prevents all disease
D) bacteria don't affect immunity

Fecal microbiota transplantation demonstrates that

A) all bacteria are harmful
B) restoring healthy microbial communities can cure certain infections
C) FMT rarely works effectively
D) diet doesn't matter

As used in context, "frontier" means

A) border region
B) an emerging area of research and discovery
C) historical settlement pattern
D) military position


Questions 19–24: Humanities Passage
The Problem of Restoration

When fire damaged Notre-Dame Cathedral in 2019, debates erupted over how to rebuild. Should restoration replicate the medieval structure exactly? Incorporate modern materials? Add contemporary elements? The questions revealed deep disagreements about what preservation means.

Strict preservationists argue authenticity requires maintaining original materials and methods. A rebuilt Notre-Dame using medieval techniques would connect directly to the craftsmen who first raised the cathedral. Modern interventions, however necessary, represent rupture with the past.

Others note that historic buildings have always evolved. Notre-Dame's famous spire, destroyed in the fire, was itself a 19th-century addition by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc—not an original medieval element. The "authentic" cathedral being mourned was already a reconstruction of sorts. Every generation adds its layer.

Practical concerns complicate philosophical positions. Medieval timber framing contributed to the fire's spread. Modern fire-resistant materials might prevent future catastrophes. Should we rebuild vulnerabilities just because they're historical?

The debate extends beyond Notre-Dame. Colonial Williamsburg recreates an 18th-century town with modern infrastructure hidden beneath period surfaces. Is this preservation or theater? Japan's tradition of periodically rebuilding sacred shrines using traditional methods treats buildings as living practices rather than static artifacts. Different cultures define authenticity differently.

Perhaps preservation is always interpretation. We decide which past to preserve, which elements matter, which changes constitute improvement versus betrayal. There is no neutral, objective standard. The restored Notre-Dame will be a 21st-century decision about what the past means to us.

The passage primarily examines

A) construction techniques
B) debates over what authentic preservation means
C) fire prevention methods
D) French politics

The destroyed Notre-Dame spire is significant because

A) it was the oldest part
B) it was itself a 19th-century addition, complicating claims about authenticity
C) no one noticed it
D) spires are unimportant

Strict preservationists would likely object to modern materials because

A) they cost more
B) they break continuity with original construction methods
C) they rarely work effectively
D) materials don't matter

Japan's tradition of rebuilding shrines suggests

A) Japan doesn't value history
B) authenticity can mean preserving practices rather than specific physical objects
C) all buildings should be rebuilt constantly
D) shrines aren't important

Colonial Williamsburg raises questions about preservation because

A) it's in Virginia
B) it presents historical appearance while hiding modern infrastructure
C) colonial history is irrelevant
D) no one visits

The final paragraph suggests preservation generally involves

A) exact replication
B) interpretation and choices about what aspects of the past matter
C) ignoring history
D) destruction


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare
Passage 1

Artificial intelligence promises to transform healthcare. Machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images with accuracy matching or exceeding human specialists. AI can process vast datasets identifying patterns invisible to human observation. These capabilities could democratize expertise, bringing specialist-level diagnosis to underserved areas.

Early applications show promise. AI systems detect diabetic retinopathy from eye scans, identify skin cancers from photographs, and spot tumors in mammograms. In each case, algorithms trained on millions of images learned to recognize subtle features humans might miss.

AI could address healthcare's fundamental challenge: expertise is scarce and expensive. Rural areas lack specialists. Developing countries cannot train enough physicians. AI assistants could extend expert capabilities globally, providing preliminary screening that helps prioritize human attention where most needed.

The technology improves continuously. Unlike human expertise, which develops slowly through years of training, AI systems can be updated instantly with new knowledge. An algorithm trained on a rare disease can be deployed worldwide overnight.

Critics worry about errors and accountability. But human physicians also make mistakes. The question isn't whether AI is perfect but whether it improves upon current care. If an AI system catches cancers that would otherwise be missed, lives are saved even if the system occasionally errs.

Passage 2

AI healthcare applications deserve skepticism before celebration. The gap between laboratory performance and real-world effectiveness is often enormous.

Training data present fundamental problems. Algorithms learn from existing medical records, which reflect historical biases. If certain populations were historically underdiagnosed, algorithms learn to perpetuate that underdiagnosis. Studies show AI dermatology tools perform worse on darker skin tones because training images skewed toward lighter skin.

"Black box" algorithms present accountability challenges. When AI recommends treatment, neither patient nor physician may understand why. If the recommendation proves wrong, who bears responsibility? Medical decisions require explainability that current AI systems often cannot provide.

The comparison to human error is misleading. When physicians err, we understand the reasoning and can correct it. AI errors may be systematic and hidden—consistently missing certain cancer types or misdiagnosing specific populations without anyone noticing until harm accumulates.

Healthcare involves more than pattern recognition. Diagnosis requires understanding patient history, social context, and values. An algorithm might identify a tumor but cannot discuss with a frightened patient whether aggressive treatment aligns with their goals. AI might optimize narrow metrics while missing what patients actually need.

Rather than replacing human judgment, AI should augment it—providing information while physicians retain decision-making authority and accountability. This more modest role may be more appropriate than the transformative claims proponents make.

Both passages agree that

A) AI should largely replace physicians
B) AI can analyze medical images effectively
C) AI is perfect
D) human physicians rarely make mistakes

Passage 2's main concern about training data is that

A) there isn't enough data
B) historical biases in data can cause AI to perpetuate discriminatory patterns
C) data doesn't matter
D) all data is accurate

How would Passage 1 likely respond to Passage 2's concerns about AI errors?

A) Deny AI makes errors
B) Argue the relevant comparison is whether AI improves upon current imperfect human care
C) Agree AI should be abandoned
D) Claim errors don't matter

Unlike Passage 1, Passage 2 emphasizes that

A) AI can process images quickly
B) healthcare involves human elements like patient values that AI cannot address
C) technology improves over time
D) expertise is scarce

Passage 2's suggestion that AI should "augment" rather than replace human judgment implies

A) AI is useless
B) physicians should retain decision-making authority while using AI as a tool
C) AI should work alone
D) human judgment is generally unreliable

The passages' relationship is best described as

A) both enthusiastically support AI in healthcare
B) Passage 1 emphasizes AI's potential benefits; Passage 2 raises significant concerns about real-world implementation
C) both oppose AI in healthcare
D) they discuss different topics
