SAT PRACTICE TEST 3

SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)

Questions 1–6: Literature Passage
The Letter

Maya found the letter tucked inside her grandmother's Bible, yellowed and fragile as autumn leaves. The handwriting was unfamiliar—looping, elegant, distinctly masculine.

"My dearest Rosalie," it began. Maya's grandmother was Rose. Had been Rose. The funeral was three days ago.

The letter was dated 1952, two years before her grandmother married Grandfather James. The writer spoke of stolen afternoons, of a future they'd planned together, of promises that read like prayers. He signed it "Forever yours, Thomas."

Maya had never heard of Thomas. She knew her grandparents' story: childhood sweethearts, married at nineteen, sixty-three years together until Grandfather's death last spring. It was the kind of love story people tell at eulogies.

But here was evidence of another story. Another love. Another life that might have been.

She could ask her mother. She could investigate, unearth whatever secrets her grandmother had buried alongside this letter. Or she could return it to the Bible, let the past remain undisturbed.

Maya thought of her grandmother in the nursing home those final months, sometimes confused, sometimes lucid. Once, she'd gripped Maya's hand and said, "I made the right choice. Remember that."

Maya had assumed she meant something medical. Now she wasn't sure.

She folded the letter carefully and slid it back between the tissue-thin pages of Genesis.

The passage primarily explores

A) the evolution of epistolary traditions and communication practices
B) how unexpected revelations can challenge previously held assumptions about familial narratives
C) the quality of care provided in long-term residential facilities
D) methods for analyzing and interpreting religious texts

The letter's physical description as "yellowed and fragile as autumn leaves" suggests

A) the document represents an intentional fabrication or deception designed to mislead readers
B) the artifact has endured significant temporal passage requiring careful preservation
C) the grandmother maintained negative associations with seasonal transitions and natural cycles
D) historical correspondence utilized botanical materials as writing surfaces and organic media

Thomas's letter reveals that

A) he and Rose maintained professional collaborative relationships and business partnerships
B) he and Rose shared romantic involvement prior to her marital commitment
C) he was Rose's biological sibling and shared genetic lineage
D) he participated in funeral observances and memorial services

Maya's knowledge of her grandparents as "childhood sweethearts" is significant because

A) it validates all claims presented in Thomas's correspondence and confirms his account
B) it introduces contradictions regarding Rose's documented romantic experiences
C) it demonstrates that Thomas's statements were intentionally false and designed to deceive
D) it establishes universal patterns in early romantic relationships that apply to all couples

The grandmother's statement "I made the right choice" likely refers to

A) selecting among available medical treatment options
B) her decision to commit to James rather than pursuing a relationship with Thomas
C) choosing a particular religious text for personal study
D) electing to relocate to an assisted living facility

Maya's decision to return the letter to the Bible suggests she

A) lacks emotional investment in her grandmother's legacy and demonstrates indifference
B) elects to preserve certain familial secrets rather than pursuing complete disclosure
C) intends to destroy the religious text through incineration and eliminate evidence
D) experiences difficulty deciphering handwritten documents and cannot read the content


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage
The Paradox of Choice in Education

American education emphasizes choice: charter schools, magnet programs, open enrollment, homeschooling options. The assumption is that more options improve outcomes by allowing families to find the best fit for each child.

Research complicates this assumption. Studies in cities with extensive school choice find modest academic improvements at best, and these gains often come at the cost of increased segregation. When families choose schools, they frequently select based on demographics rather than educational quality, effectively self-sorting by race and class.

Information asymmetries compound the problem. Wealthy, educated parents research school performance data, visit campuses, and network with other parents. Lower-income families often lack time, transportation, and access to navigate complex choice systems. "Choice" becomes meaningful only for those with resources to exercise it.

Some argue choice creates healthy competition, forcing schools to improve or lose students. Yet schools serving disadvantaged populations face challenges—higher special education needs, more English learners, greater poverty impacts—that make direct comparison unfair. A school might be doing excellent work with struggling students while appearing inferior on standardized metrics to schools serving privileged populations.

The deeper question is whether market logic belongs in education at all. Markets work well for commodities where informed consumers can evaluate quality. Education involves long-term, complex outcomes difficult for any individual to assess. A parent choosing a kindergarten cannot evaluate whether that choice will affect college readiness thirteen years later.

Perhaps the focus on choice distracts from ensuring all schools provide excellent education. Rather than helping some families escape struggling schools, we might invest in making every school worth choosing.

The passage primarily argues that

A) educational choice mechanisms universally enhance learning outcomes across all contexts
B) school choice generates multifaceted consequences that may disproportionately benefit certain demographic groups
C) all educational institutions demonstrate equivalent quality and effectiveness
D) parental engagement in educational decision-making lacks significance

According to the passage, school choice sometimes increases segregation because

A) educational institutions engage in deliberate discriminatory practices and exclusionary policies
B) families frequently prioritize demographic factors over academic quality when selecting schools
C) transportation infrastructure prevents access to preferred institutions and creates barriers
D) all schools demonstrate equivalent educational effectiveness and provide identical opportunities

"Information asymmetries" in school choice means

A) educational institutions deliberately conceal relevant data from families and restrict transparency
B) families with greater socioeconomic resources possess superior information access for decision-making
C) all families have equivalent access to information necessary for school selection and decision processes
D) information availability has no bearing on educational choice outcomes and decision quality

The passage suggests that comparing schools serving different populations is problematic because

A) all educational institutions demonstrate identical characteristics and outcomes without variation
B) schools encounter distinct challenges reflecting the specific needs and circumstances of their student populations
C) comparative analysis never provides meaningful insights into educational quality or effectiveness
D) standardized assessment instruments are unavailable for evaluation purposes and cannot be used

The author questions applying "market logic" to education because

A) market mechanisms inevitably produce systemic failures in all contexts and always fail
B) educational outcomes involve intricate long-term processes that resist immediate assessment
C) parents demonstrate insufficient concern for their children's welfare and neglect responsibilities
D) competitive dynamics have no legitimate role in educational systems and should be eliminated

The final paragraph suggests the author favors

A) complete elimination of formal educational institutions
B) enhancing educational quality universally rather than facilitating selective exit from underperforming schools
C) expanding the range of available educational options and alternatives
D) transferring all educational provision to private sector entities


Questions 13–18: Natural Science Passage
The Microbiome and Human Health

The human body hosts trillions of microorganisms—bacteria, viruses, fungi—collectively called the microbiome. Far from being merely passengers or parasites, these microbes perform essential functions affecting digestion, immunity, and even brain function.

The gut microbiome alone contains hundreds of bacterial species. These bacteria break down fiber humans cannot digest, producing short-chain fatty acids that nourish intestinal cells. They synthesize vitamins, including B12 and K. They train the immune system, helping it distinguish between harmful pathogens and benign substances.

Research increasingly links microbiome composition to health outcomes. People with inflammatory bowel disease show reduced microbial diversity. Obesity correlates with altered bacterial ratios. Some studies suggest microbiome differences may influence conditions from allergies to depression.

The mechanisms remain partly mysterious. The gut-brain axis—communication between intestinal bacteria and the central nervous system—appears to involve neural pathways, immune signaling, and bacterial metabolites. Exactly how bacteria in the intestine might affect mood or cognition is still being investigated.

Modern life may be disrupting healthy microbiomes. Antibiotics kill beneficial bacteria alongside pathogens. Highly processed diets provide less fiber that feeds beneficial species. Reduced contact with diverse environmental microbes—the "hygiene hypothesis"—may impair immune development.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) demonstrates the microbiome's importance. For patients with recurrent C. difficile infections—a potentially deadly intestinal disease—transplanting stool from healthy donors restores microbial balance with remarkable success rates exceeding 90%.

The microbiome represents a frontier of medicine. We're only beginning to understand how the bacteria we host shape our health.

The passage primarily

A) argues against all bacteria
B) explains the microbiome's roles and its emerging importance in medicine
C) describes one specific disease
D) promotes probiotic supplements

A) attacking food directly
B) breaking down fiber and producing vitamins
C) eliminating all other bacteria
D) bypassing the intestine

The "hygiene hypothesis" suggests that

A) cleanliness is unimportant
B) reduced exposure to diverse microbes may impair immune development
C) hygiene prevents all disease
D) bacteria don't affect immunity

Fecal microbiota transplantation demonstrates that

A) all bacteria are harmful
B) restoring healthy microbial communities can cure certain infections
C) FMT never works
D) diet doesn't matter

A) border region
B) an emerging area of research and discovery
C) historical settlement pattern
D) military position


Questions 19–24: Humanities Passage
The Problem of Restoration

When fire damaged Notre-Dame Cathedral in 2019, debates erupted over how to rebuild. Should restoration replicate the medieval structure exactly? Incorporate modern materials? Add contemporary elements? The questions revealed deep disagreements about what preservation means.

Strict preservationists argue authenticity requires maintaining original materials and methods. A rebuilt Notre-Dame using medieval techniques would connect directly to the craftsmen who first raised the cathedral. Modern interventions, however necessary, represent rupture with the past.

Others note that historic buildings have always evolved. Notre-Dame's famous spire, destroyed in the fire, was itself a 19th-century addition by architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc—not an original medieval element. The "authentic" cathedral being mourned was already a reconstruction of sorts. Every generation adds its layer.

Practical concerns complicate philosophical positions. Medieval timber framing contributed to the fire's spread. Modern fire-resistant materials might prevent future catastrophes. Should we rebuild vulnerabilities just because they're historical?

The debate extends beyond Notre-Dame. Colonial Williamsburg recreates an 18th-century town with modern infrastructure hidden beneath period surfaces. Is this preservation or theater? Japan's tradition of periodically rebuilding sacred shrines using traditional methods treats buildings as living practices rather than static artifacts. Different cultures define authenticity differently.

Perhaps preservation is always interpretation. We decide which past to preserve, which elements matter, which changes constitute improvement versus betrayal. There is no neutral, objective standard. The restored Notre-Dame will be a 21st-century decision about what the past means to us.

The passage primarily examines

A) construction techniques
B) debates over what authentic preservation means
C) fire prevention methods
D) French politics

The destroyed Notre-Dame spire is significant because

A) it was the oldest part
B) it was itself a 19th-century addition, complicating claims about authenticity
C) no one noticed it
D) spires are unimportant

Strict preservationists would likely object to modern materials because

A) they cost more
B) they break continuity with original construction methods
C) they never work
D) materials don't matter

Japan's tradition of rebuilding shrines suggests

A) Japan doesn't value history
B) authenticity can mean preserving practices rather than specific physical objects
C) all buildings should be rebuilt constantly
D) shrines aren't important

Colonial Williamsburg raises questions about preservation because

A) it's in Virginia
B) it presents historical appearance while hiding modern infrastructure
C) colonial history is irrelevant
D) no one visits

The final paragraph suggests preservation always involves

A) exact replication
B) interpretation and choices about what aspects of the past matter
C) ignoring history
D) destruction


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare
Passage 1

Artificial intelligence promises to transform healthcare. Machine learning algorithms can analyze medical images with accuracy matching or exceeding human specialists. AI can process vast datasets identifying patterns invisible to human observation. These capabilities could democratize expertise, bringing specialist-level diagnosis to underserved areas.

Early applications show promise. AI systems detect diabetic retinopathy from eye scans, identify skin cancers from photographs, and spot tumors in mammograms. In each case, algorithms trained on millions of images learned to recognize subtle features humans might miss.

AI could address healthcare's fundamental challenge: expertise is scarce and expensive. Rural areas lack specialists. Developing countries cannot train enough physicians. AI assistants could extend expert capabilities globally, providing preliminary screening that helps prioritize human attention where most needed.

The technology improves continuously. Unlike human expertise, which develops slowly through years of training, AI systems can be updated instantly with new knowledge. An algorithm trained on a rare disease can be deployed worldwide overnight.

Critics worry about errors and accountability. But human physicians also make mistakes. The question isn't whether AI is perfect but whether it improves upon current care. If an AI system catches cancers that would otherwise be missed, lives are saved even if the system occasionally errs.

Passage 2

AI healthcare applications deserve skepticism before celebration. The gap between laboratory performance and real-world effectiveness is often enormous.

Training data present fundamental problems. Algorithms learn from existing medical records, which reflect historical biases. If certain populations were historically underdiagnosed, algorithms learn to perpetuate that underdiagnosis. Studies show AI dermatology tools perform worse on darker skin tones because training images skewed toward lighter skin.

"Black box" algorithms present accountability challenges. When AI recommends treatment, neither patient nor physician may understand why. If the recommendation proves wrong, who bears responsibility? Medical decisions require explainability that current AI systems often cannot provide.

The comparison to human error is misleading. When physicians err, we understand the reasoning and can correct it. AI errors may be systematic and hidden—consistently missing certain cancer types or misdiagnosing specific populations without anyone noticing until harm accumulates.

Healthcare involves more than pattern recognition. Diagnosis requires understanding patient history, social context, and values. An algorithm might identify a tumor but cannot discuss with a frightened patient whether aggressive treatment aligns with their goals. AI might optimize narrow metrics while missing what patients actually need.

Rather than replacing human judgment, AI should augment it—providing information while physicians retain decision-making authority and accountability. This more modest role may be more appropriate than the transformative claims proponents make.

Both passages agree that

A) AI should completely replace physicians
B) AI can analyze medical images effectively
C) AI is perfect
D) human physicians never make mistakes

Passage 2's main concern about training data is that

A) there isn't enough data
B) historical biases in data can cause AI to perpetuate discriminatory patterns
C) data doesn't matter
D) all data is accurate

How would Passage 1 likely respond to Passage 2's concerns about AI errors?

A) Deny AI makes errors
B) Argue the relevant comparison is whether AI improves upon current imperfect human care
C) Agree AI should be abandoned
D) Claim errors don't matter

Unlike Passage 1, Passage 2 emphasizes that

A) AI can process images quickly
B) healthcare involves human elements like patient values that AI cannot address
C) technology improves over time
D) expertise is scarce

Passage 2's suggestion that AI should "augment" rather than replace human judgment implies

A) AI is useless
B) physicians should retain decision-making authority while using AI as a tool
C) AI should work alone
D) human judgment is always wrong

The passages' relationship is best described as

A) both enthusiastically support AI in healthcare
B) Passage 1 emphasizes AI's potential benefits; Passage 2 raises significant concerns about real-world implementation
C) both oppose AI in healthcare
D) they discuss different topics
