SAT PRACTICE TEST 2

SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)

---

**Question 1**

The lawyer's office smelled of old paper and furniture polish. My brother Michael sat across from me, his expression carefully neutral—a skill he'd perfected over years of family gatherings where emotion was vulnerability. The antique pearl necklace, worn by three generations of women in our family, would go to Michael. Not because he wanted it—but because he had sons, and I had daughters. "Traditional family heirlooms pass through the male line," my mother had explained once. Michael cleared his throat. "I was thinking that maybe we should update some of these traditions."

The passage primarily explores

A) the technical legal mechanisms governing property transfer after death
B) the tension between inherited traditions and contemporary values within families
C) competitive dynamics between siblings regarding material inheritance distribution
D) methodologies for determining the monetary value of heirloom objects

---

**Question 2**

My brother Michael sat across from me, his expression carefully neutral—a skill he'd perfected over years of family gatherings where emotion was vulnerability. In forty years, Michael had never questioned our mother's decisions. He was the good son, the one who called every Sunday, who married appropriately, who lived three blocks away instead of three states. Yet now, in the lawyer's office, something was shifting. "The necklace should go to Rebecca," he said, naming my eldest daughter. "She'd actually wear it."

Michael's "carefully neutral" expression suggests he has

A) no emotional investment in family relationships and demonstrates clinical indifference
B) developed strategies for managing emotions within potentially volatile family interactions
C) deep resentment toward his sister that he conceals beneath surface politeness
D) difficulty understanding complex legal language and bureaucratic procedures

---

**Question 3**

The antique pearl necklace would go to Michael. Not because he wanted it—Michael cared as much about jewelry as I cared about his golf clubs. But because he had sons, and I had daughters. The tradition made no practical sense: neither Michael nor his sons would ever wear the necklace, while my daughter Rebecca had admired it since childhood. Yet family logic operated on different principles than practical sense, following channels carved generations ago.

The narrator's comment about golf clubs reveals that

A) she plays golf regularly and appreciates quality sporting equipment
B) Michael secretly dislikes golf but maintains appearances for social reasons
C) both siblings have limited interest in objects conventionally associated with their genders
D) golf equipment represents a more valuable investment than antique jewelry

---

**Question 4**

"Traditional family heirlooms pass through the male line," my mother had explained once, as if this made perfect sense. As if my daughters, her granddaughters, were somehow less family than Michael's boys. The logic had been internalized so thoroughly that questioning it felt almost sacrilegious—like doubting gravity or sunrise. My mother never recognized the contradiction between her fierce advocacy for women's equality at work and her unquestioning acceptance of patrilineal inheritance at home.

The mother's explanation about "traditional family heirlooms" indicates her belief that

A) family continuity flows authentically only through male descendants
B) female family members lack the responsibility to properly care for valuable items
C) legal frameworks should override personal preferences in all inheritance matters
D) daughters are intellectually incapable of appreciating historical significance

---

**Question 5**

Michael was the good son, the one who called every Sunday, who married appropriately, who lived three blocks away instead of three states. He had followed every expectation without apparent resistance, earning our mother's approval through steady compliance. I had moved to California, married a man she tolerated rather than loved, pursued a career she considered unfeminine. Yet here in the lawyer's office, the good son was questioning what I never dared challenge.

Michael is described as "the good son" primarily because he

A) demonstrated superior intellectual and professional achievements compared to his sister
B) consistently aligned his choices with parental expectations and cultural norms
C) achieved greater financial success through shrewd business decisions
D) maintained a larger and more impressive home than other family members

---

**Question 6**

"The necklace should go to Rebecca," Michael continued. "She's graduating law school this year. She'd actually wear it." Something shifted in my chest. In forty years, Michael had never questioned our mother's decisions. Maybe families weren't just about following traditions. Maybe they were about choosing which traditions deserved to continue—and which had outlived their purpose, serving only to perpetuate inequities that newer generations recognized but older ones could not see.

The final paragraph suggests the narrator recognizes that

A) all traditional practices should be immediately abandoned without consideration
B) families have agency to evaluate and selectively modify inherited customs
C) Michael's suggestion represents manipulation rather than genuine generosity
D) traditions possess no meaningful value and exist only as arbitrary constraints

---

**Question 7**

Americans increasingly treat sleep as optional—a luxury for the unambitious. CEOs boast about sleeping four hours nightly; college students pull all-nighters as badges of honor. This cultural valorization of sleeplessness ignores mounting evidence that sleep deprivation carries severe cognitive and health consequences. During sleep, the brain consolidates memories, transferring information from temporary to long-term storage. Sleep-deprived individuals show impaired memory formation, struggling to retain new information despite adequate study time.

The passage primarily argues that

A) sleep cycle stages have been comprehensively documented by recent research
B) cultural celebration of sleeplessness overlooks serious cognitive and health consequences
C) corporate executives deserve personal criticism for their lifestyle choices
D) the neurological mechanisms of dream formation require further scientific study

---

**Question 8**

During sleep, the brain consolidates memories, transferring information from temporary to long-term storage. This process explains why cramming for exams yields worse retention than studying followed by adequate sleep—the material never transitions to permanent memory. Sleep-deprived students often report feeling they studied effectively, then discover during exams that information simply didn't stick. The subjective experience of learning can be misleading without the consolidation sleep provides.

Memory consolidation during sleep primarily involves

A) achieving perfect recall of dream content upon awakening
B) transferring information from temporary to permanent memory systems
C) generating inaccurate memory traces that distort actual experiences
D) progressive degradation of memory function throughout sleep periods

---

**Question 9**

Research comparing sleep-deprived individuals to those with 0.08% blood alcohol—the legal intoxication limit—found similar impairment in reaction time and judgment. Yet our society condemns drunk driving while celebrating executives who make multimillion-dollar decisions on four hours of sleep. The inconsistency reveals cultural blind spots: we recognize alcohol-induced impairment as dangerous but romanticize sleep-deprivation-induced impairment as evidence of dedication and ambition.

The comparison to legal intoxication serves primarily to

A) suggest that alcohol consumption and sleep loss produce identical neurological effects
B) highlight a societal inconsistency in how different forms of impairment are perceived
C) advocate for stricter drunk driving laws with more severe penalties
D) argue that sleep-deprived individuals should face criminal prosecution
---

**Question 10**

REM sleep, when vivid dreaming occurs, facilitates novel connections between disparate concepts. Studies show sleep-deprived individuals perform worse on tasks requiring creative problem-solving, instead relying on conventional approaches. The brain during REM appears to test unusual associations—linking ideas that waking consciousness would dismiss as irrelevant. Artists and scientists historically report breakthrough insights emerging from dream states, suggesting REM's creative function extends beyond laboratory settings.

According to the passage, REM sleep facilitates creativity by

A) eliminating irrelevant memories that might interfere with focused thinking
B) generating connections between previously unconnected ideas and concepts
C) permanently enhancing general cognitive abilities in measurable ways
D) suppressing anxiety-related thoughts that inhibit creative expression

---

**Question 11**

Some argue individual variation matters more than sleep duration. Indeed, approximately 1–3% of the population genuinely functions well on limited sleep—a genetic trait researchers have begun to identify. However, most people who claim to "not need much sleep" show measurable impairment on objective tests despite believing themselves alert. The gap between subjective confidence and objective performance is striking: participants often insist they're functioning normally while test scores reveal significant deficits.

The passage indicates that most people who claim not to need much sleep

A) accurately understand their biological sleep requirements through self-awareness
B) represent genetic variants with genuinely reduced sleep needs
C) show objective cognitive deficits despite subjective feelings of alertness
D) demonstrate exceptional health outcomes compared to average populations

---

**Question 12**

The solution requires cultural shift. Workplaces should stop rewarding presenteeism—valuing physical presence over actual productivity—and impossible schedules. Schools should start later, aligning with adolescent circadian rhythms that naturally delay sleep onset. Individuals should prioritize sleep as essential health behavior, not indulgent weakness. The culture of sleeplessness serves no one except employers extracting unsustainable hours from workers.

As used in the passage, "presenteeism" most nearly means

A) the skill of giving effective presentations at work
B) being physically present at work regardless of actual productivity
C) policies requiring consistent workplace attendance
D) the practice of public speaking in professional settings

---

**Question 13**

Stars at galactic edges orbit far faster than visible matter's gravity should allow. They should fly off into space—or galaxies should rotate like solar systems, with inner objects moving faster than outer ones. Instead, galaxies rotate like solid disks, suggesting invisible mass—"dark matter"—comprising approximately 85% of the universe's matter. Dark matter doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light; it interacts with ordinary matter only through gravity, making direct detection extraordinarily challenging.

The observation that galaxies rotate "like solid disks" is significant because it

A) demonstrates that galaxies are actually solid physical objects
B) suggests matter distribution extends invisibly beyond what telescopes can observe
C) proves galaxies don't actually rotate at all
D) indicates galaxies were artificially constructed by advanced beings

---

**Question 14**

Gravitational lensing—massive objects bending light from distant sources—provides additional dark matter evidence. When astronomers map where mass must be located to produce observed lensing effects, they consistently find more mass than visible matter can account for. The Bullet Cluster, where two galaxy clusters collided, proved particularly revealing: gravitational lensing showed mass concentrated separately from the visible hot gas, demonstrating that most mass is invisible.

Gravitational lensing provides evidence for dark matter by

A) directly illuminating dark matter particles so telescopes can photograph them
B) revealing more mass than visible matter alone can account for
C) creating new dark matter through gravitational compression effects
D) demonstrating that gravity doesn't actually exist at cosmological scales

---

**Question 15**

Initial hypotheses suggested ordinary matter—dim stars, rogue planets, black holes—could account for missing mass. However, calculations based on Big Bang nucleosynthesis proved otherwise. The early universe's physics constrained how much ordinary matter could form; observations of light element abundances confirm these limits. Ordinary matter comprises only about 5% of the universe—insufficient to explain dark matter's gravitational effects. Whatever dark matter is, it isn't ordinary atoms.

Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations are relevant to dark matter research because they

A) describe how dark matter was originally created in the early universe
B) establish that ordinary matter cannot account for dark matter's observed mass
C) prove dark matter has the same composition as ordinary atomic matter
D) demonstrate fundamental errors in Einstein's gravitational theories

---

**Question 16**

Leading dark matter candidates are WIMPs—Weakly Interacting Massive Particles. These hypothetical particles would pass through ordinary matter almost undetected, interacting only rarely. Despite decades of increasingly sensitive experiments in underground laboratories shielded from cosmic rays, WIMPs remain undetected. Alternative proposals include axions—extremely light particles—or modifications to gravity itself rather than new particles. Each null result constrains possibilities, narrowing the search.

WIMPs are challenging to detect primarily because they

A) probably do not actually exist in any form
B) interact extremely weakly with ordinary matter and pass through detectors
C) move too rapidly for current instruments to track
D) are physically too large for detector apertures to capture

---

**Question 17**

Dark matter represents what one physicist called "humbling ignorance." We've identified 85% of the universe's matter through gravitational effects—it bends light, holds galaxies together, shaped cosmic structure—yet remain fundamentally ignorant of its nature. The universe's primary material constituent remains mysterious. Science often proceeds by recognizing what we don't know, and dark matter represents our most significant acknowledged ignorance about reality's basic composition.

The phrase "humbling ignorance" suggests that dark matter research

A) demonstrates scientific incompetence requiring new approaches
B) represents honest acknowledgment of knowledge limits about a fundamental cosmic component
C) should be abandoned in favor of more tractable problems
D) proves that scientific ignorance is ultimately preferable to incomplete knowledge

---

**Question 18**

Some scientists question whether dark matter exists at all. Modified gravity theories—MOND and its successors—propose that gravity behaves differently at galactic scales than Einstein predicted, eliminating the need for invisible matter. These theories can explain galaxy rotation curves. However, they struggle to explain the full range of observations—gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters, cosmic microwave background patterns, structure formation simulations—that dark matter explains elegantly and consistently.

The passage suggests that modified gravity theories face what primary challenge?

A) They have been definitively proven incorrect by recent experiments
B) They cannot explain the full range of observations that dark matter explains consistently
C) They require more dark matter than standard models predict
D) They are too mathematically simple to describe complex gravitational phenomena


---

**Question 19**

Street art occupies an ambiguous cultural space—simultaneously celebrated in galleries and prosecuted as vandalism. Museums exhibit photographs of street art in "outsider art" exhibitions while cities pressure-wash the originals. Society celebrates street art's authenticity while criminalizing the authentic act of creating it illegally. This contradiction reveals unresolved tensions about what constitutes art, who controls public space, and whether breaking laws for artistic expression merits tolerance.

The passage is primarily concerned with

A) providing technical instruction in graffiti techniques and methods
B) examining contradictions in how society simultaneously values and criminalizes street art
C) arguing that all forms of graffiti should be immediately legalized
D) providing a comprehensive biography of famous street artist Banksy

---

**Question 20**

Graffiti emerged in 1970s New York as territorial marking and political expression by marginalized communities. Early graffiti writers "tagged" subway cars and buildings, creating elaborate lettering styles that became increasingly sophisticated. Authorities viewed this as vandalism requiring prosecution; participants viewed it as reclaiming public space from which they'd been systematically excluded. The same act carried opposite meanings depending on perspective—destruction versus expression, crime versus art.

Early graffiti writers viewed tagging primarily as

A) vandalism deserving legal punishment and community condemnation
B) meaningless destruction with no artistic or political purpose
C) reclaiming public space from which they had been excluded
D) preparation for eventual transition to gallery-based careers

---

**Question 21**

The art world's embrace of street art began in the 1980s when artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat transitioned from street tagging to gallery exhibitions. This mainstream acceptance created controversy within graffiti communities. Some viewed gallery representation as selling out—abandoning street art's oppositional stance for commercial success and respectability. Others saw it as deserved recognition for genuine artistic skill that happened to develop in unconventional contexts.

The controversy over gallery representation suggests that

A) all street artists secretly aspire to gallery exhibitions
B) commercial success can conflict with street art's origins as oppositional expression
C) galleries have consistently refused to exhibit graffiti-inspired work
D) street art lacks the artistic merit required for institutional recognition

---

**Question 22**

When a Banksy piece appeared on a building, property owners faced unexpected dilemmas: remove "vandalism" as legally required, or preserve what might be worth millions? Some owners cut entire walls from buildings to sell Banksy pieces at auction—commercializing art that was created specifically in opposition to commercialization. The situation perfectly encapsulated street art's contradictions: illegal creation producing legally protected property, anti-commercial expression generating enormous commercial value.

Property owners' dilemmas regarding Banksy pieces reveal

A) confusion about standard insurance policies for vandalism damage
B) tension between legal status as vandalism and market value as collectible art
C) Banksy's personal intervention in real estate transactions
D) unanimous property owner enthusiasm for street art preservation

---

**Question 23**

Street artists argue that omnipresent corporate advertising occupies public consciousness without consent, making unsanctioned art a form of legitimate resistance. If Coca-Cola can paint our visual landscape with logos—on billboards, buses, buildings—why shouldn't artists paint meaningful images? Property owners counter that they control their walls and should determine what appears on them. The debate centers on who truly "owns" shared visual environments in democratic societies.

The street artist argument described in the passage suggests that

A) corporate advertising has no meaningful presence in public spaces
B) unauthorized art can be justified as resistance to commercial domination of visual space
C) property owners unanimously support street art on their buildings
D) all forms of outdoor advertising should be immediately banned

---

**Question 24**

Legal and cultural status of street art varies dramatically across jurisdictions. Some cities designate specific walls welcoming street art; others prosecute all unauthorized marking as serious vandalism. This patchwork reflects genuinely unresolved debates about art's definition, public space ownership, and whether creative intent mitigates legal violations. The same image might be celebrated in Melbourne's famous laneways while earning criminal charges in Singapore.

The international variation in street art's legal status reflects

A) uniform international agreement on cultural property definitions
B) unresolved debates about art, public space, and the relevance of creative intent
C) differences in climate affecting paint durability on exterior surfaces
D) variations in urban architecture requiring different regulatory approaches
B) the tension between vandalism prosecution and valuable art preservation
C) unanimous agreement that street art is vandalism
D) lack of appreciation for art

The comparison to corporate advertising suggests street artists believe that

A) advertising is generally ethical
B) Coca-Cola should sponsor street art
C) if commercial messages occupy public space without consent, artistic expression should be similarly permitted
D) corporations create better art than individuals

"Outsider art" exhibitions photographing street art that cities remove is ironic because

A) photography is expensive
B) museums have poor lighting
C) society values street art institutionally while criminalizing its authentic illegal creation
D) photographers don't get permission


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Nuclear Energy
Passage 1

Climate change demands rapid decarbonization. Renewable energy alone cannot achieve necessary emissions reductions quickly enough. Nuclear power—carbon-free, reliable, and proven—must be part of the solution.

Solar and wind face intermittency problems. The sun doesn't always shine; wind doesn't always blow. Battery storage helps but remains expensive and insufficient for multi-day storage needs. Nuclear provides consistent baseload power regardless of weather, complementing renewables effectively.

Modern reactor designs address safety concerns. Fukushima resulted from outdated technology vulnerable to natural disasters. New designs feature passive safety systems that don't require operator intervention or external power. They cannot experience meltdowns like Chernobyl or Fukushima.

Waste concerns are overstated. Nuclear waste volume is tiny compared to fossil fuel pollution. One person's lifetime electricity from nuclear produces waste fitting in a soda can. Reprocessing technologies can reduce waste further while extracting more energy. Long-term storage is solvable through geological repositories.

France generates 70% of electricity from nuclear, achieving low emissions and reliable power. Their success demonstrates nuclear viability. Rejecting nuclear based on outdated fears means accepting slower climate action and continued fossil fuel dependence.

Passage 2

Nuclear power's climate benefits are undermined by its costs, risks, and timeline. We don't have decades for new nuclear plants while cheaper, faster alternatives exist.

Nuclear plants take 10–15 years to build and cost billions. Vogtle's recent Georgia reactors cost $30 billion—double initial estimates—and took 14 years. That money could have funded massive renewable deployment with storage, achieving greater emissions reductions faster.

"Modern safe reactors" remain largely hypothetical. Few next-generation designs have been built commercially. Relying on unproven technology while proven renewables exist is risky. Even modern reactors face challenges: uranium mining's environmental impact, thermal pollution, and vulnerability to climate change—droughts threaten cooling water supplies.

Waste disposal remains unsolved. No country has successfully implemented permanent high-level waste storage. "Geological repositories" sound simple but face enormous technical and political challenges. The U.S. abandoned Yucca Mountain after decades and billions spent. Waste accumulates at reactor sites indefinitely.

France's nuclear dependence creates vulnerabilities. In 2022, drought and maintenance issues forced unprecedented reactor shutdowns, creating energy crises. Centralized nuclear systems are less resilient than distributed renewable networks.

Renewables plus storage have dropped dramatically in cost and improve continuously. Nuclear costs remain high or increase. Betting on expensive, slow nuclear diverts resources from solutions deployable today.

Both passages would likely agree that

A) nuclear energy produces zero emissions during operation
B) renewable energy is largely sufficient on its own
C) cost is irrelevant to energy policy
D) France has abandoned nuclear power

Passage 1 emphasizes intermittency to argue that

A) solar and wind are largely ineffective
B) nuclear provides reliable baseload power complementing renewable limitations
C) batteries are unlikely to improve significantly
D) weather is unpredictable

How would Passage 2 respond to Passage 1's claims about modern reactor safety?

A) By agreeing substantially
B) By noting most designs remain hypothetical and unproven commercially
C) By denying safety improvements exist
D) By arguing safety is irrelevant

Unlike Passage 1, Passage 2 emphasizes

A) carbon emissions
B) France's energy system
C) construction timelines and costs compared to renewable alternatives
D) waste volume relative to fossil fuels

Passage 1 would likely respond to Passage 2's cost arguments by

A) admitting nuclear is too expensive
B) arguing that climate urgency justifies costs and that proven low-carbon technology matters more than speed alone
C) agreeing renewables are superior in every respect
D) denying that nuclear plants are expensive

The passages' relationship is best described as

A) Passage 1 advocates nuclear as a climate solution; Passage 2 questions its practicality and cost-effectiveness
B) Both passages oppose nuclear power
C) Both passages support nuclear power
D) They discuss different energy sources without overlap
