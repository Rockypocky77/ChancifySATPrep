SAT PRACTICE TEST 2

SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)

Questions 1–6: Literature – Family Dynamics
The Inheritance

The lawyer's office smelled of old paper and furniture polish. My brother Michael sat across from me, his expression carefully neutral—a skill he'd perfected over years of family gatherings where emotion was vulnerability.

"Your mother's will specifies equal division of assets," the lawyer began. "However, she left specific instructions regarding family heirlooms."

I already knew what was coming. The antique pearl necklace, worn by three generations of women in our family, would go to Michael. Not because he wanted it—Michael cared as much about jewelry as I cared about his golf clubs. But because he had sons, and I had daughters.

"Traditional family heirlooms pass through the male line," my mother had explained once, as if this made perfect sense. As if my daughters, her granddaughters, were somehow less family than Michael's boys.

Michael cleared his throat. "I was thinking," he said carefully, "that maybe we should update some of these traditions."

I looked at him, surprised. In forty years, Michael had never questioned our mother's decisions. He was the good son, the one who called every Sunday, who married appropriately, who lived three blocks away instead of three states.

"The necklace should go to Rebecca," he continued, naming my eldest. "She's graduating law school this year. She'd actually wear it."

Something shifted in my chest. Maybe families weren't just about following traditions. Maybe they were about choosing which traditions deserved to continue.

The passage primarily explores

A) the technical legal mechanisms governing property transfer after death
B) the complex negotiation between inherited cultural practices and contemporary value systems
C) competitive dynamics between siblings regarding material inheritance
D) methodologies for determining the monetary value of heirloom objects

Michael's "carefully neutral" expression suggests he

A) lacks emotional investment in maternal relationships and demonstrates indifference
B) has developed strategies for emotional regulation within familial interactions
C) experiences resentment toward his sibling and harbors negative feelings
D) finds legal processes incomprehensible or overwhelming and struggles with complexity

The narrator's comment about golf clubs reveals that

A) she maintains active participation in competitive golf activities and regular practice
B) Michael demonstrates minimal genuine interest in golf as a recreational pursuit or hobby
C) both siblings exhibit limited attachment to objects associated with conventional gender expectations
D) golf equipment possesses greater economic value than jewelry items and represents better investments

The mother's explanation about "traditional family heirlooms" indicates her belief that

A) patrilineal descent represents the exclusive mechanism for authentic family continuity
B) female family members lack capacity for appreciating valuable objects
C) statutory legal frameworks determine all inheritance distributions
D) daughters possess inherently inferior intellectual capabilities compared to sons

Michael is described as "the good son" primarily because he

A) demonstrates superior intellectual abilities relative to his sibling
B) maintained alignment with parental norms and expectations throughout his life
C) achieved greater financial success than his sister
D) resides in more substantial housing accommodations than his sister

The final line suggests the narrator recognizes that

A) complete rejection of all traditional practices represents the optimal approach
B) families possess agency in selectively preserving or modifying inherited customs
C) Michael's actions represent calculated attempts to influence her decisions
D) traditional practices lack any inherent value or significance


Questions 7–12: Social Science – Sleep Deprivation
The Cognitive Cost of Sleep Loss

Americans increasingly treat sleep as optional—a luxury for the unambitious. CEOs boast about sleeping four hours nightly. College students pull all-nighters as badges of honor. This cultural valorization of sleeplessness ignores mounting evidence that sleep deprivation carries severe cognitive and health consequences.

Sleep performs essential maintenance. During sleep, the brain consolidates memories, transferring information from temporary to long-term storage. Sleep-deprived individuals show impaired memory formation, struggling to retain new information despite adequate study time.

Decision-making also suffers. Research comparing sleep-deprived individuals to those with 0.08% blood alcohol—the legal intoxication limit—found similar impairment in reaction time and judgment. Yet we condemn drunk driving while celebrating executives who make multimillion-dollar decisions on four hours of sleep.

Creativity declines too. REM sleep, when vivid dreaming occurs, facilitates novel connections between disparate concepts. Studies show sleep-deprived individuals perform worse on tasks requiring creative problem-solving, instead relying on conventional approaches.

Physical health consequences compound cognitive effects. Chronic sleep deprivation increases risks of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and early mortality. Sleep deprivation disrupts hormone regulation, increasing appetite while decreasing satiety signals—explaining links to weight gain.

Some argue individual variation matters more than sleep duration. Indeed, some genuinely function well on less sleep—but they represent perhaps 1–3% of the population. Most people who claim to "not need much sleep" show measurable impairment on objective tests despite subjective belief in their alertness.

The solution requires cultural shift. Workplaces should stop rewarding presenteeism and impossible schedules. Schools should start later, aligning with adolescent circadian rhythms. Individuals should prioritize sleep as essential health behavior, not indulgent weakness.

The passage primarily aims to

A) provide comprehensive documentation of sleep cycle stages and their characteristics
B) contend that societal normalization of sleep deprivation overlooks significant cognitive and health risks
C) direct personal criticism toward corporate leadership figures
D) elucidate the neurological mechanisms underlying dream formation

Memory consolidation during sleep means that

A) individuals achieve perfect recall of dream content upon awakening and complete memory accuracy
B) neural processes facilitate the transition of information from temporary to permanent memory systems
C) sleep mechanisms generate inaccurate or fabricated memory traces that distort actual experiences
D) memory function degrades progressively throughout sleep periods and becomes less reliable

The comparison to legal intoxication suggests that

A) alcohol consumption and sleep loss produce identical neurological effects and brain responses
B) impaired driving represents a less significant public health risk than sleep deficiency and its consequences
C) social responses to equivalent cognitive impairment demonstrate contradictory standards and inconsistent policies
D) legal intoxication thresholds lack scientific validity or relevance and should be substantially revised

According to the passage, REM sleep facilitates creativity by

A) selectively removing irrelevant or redundant memory traces that interfere with creative thinking
B) generating associative links between previously unconnected conceptual domains
C) producing permanent enhancements in general cognitive ability that persist indefinitely
D) suppressing disturbing or anxiety-provoking dream content that might inhibit creative processes

The passage indicates that most people who claim not to need much sleep

A) accurately evaluate their own sleep requirements and understand their biological needs
B) exemplify substantial genetic diversity in sleep needs across populations and individual variation
C) exhibit objective cognitive deficits despite subjective perceptions of alertness and capability
D) demonstrate superior health outcomes compared to population averages and exceptional resilience

As used in context, "presenteeism" most nearly means

A) giving presentations at work
B) being physically present regardless of productivity
C) public speaking skills
D) workplace attendance policies


Questions 13–18: Natural Science – Dark Matter
The Universe's Missing Mass

Observations of galaxy rotation revealed a cosmic mystery. Stars at galactic edges orbit far faster than visible matter's gravity should allow. They should either fly off into space or galaxies should rotate differently—with inner stars moving faster than outer ones, like planets orbiting the sun.

Instead, galaxies rotate like solid disks. This suggests invisible mass—"dark matter"—comprising approximately 85% of the universe's matter. Dark matter doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light, interacting only through gravity.

Evidence extends beyond rotation curves. Gravitational lensing—massive objects bending light from distant sources—reveals more mass than visible matter accounts for. The cosmic microwave background radiation's pattern requires dark matter to explain structure formation. Computer simulations of galaxy formation only match observations when including dark matter.

Yet dark matter's composition remains unknown. Initial hypotheses suggested ordinary matter—dim stars, planets, black holes—could account for missing mass. However, calculations based on Big Bang nucleosynthesis prove ordinary matter cannot comprise the bulk of dark matter.

Leading candidates are WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles)—hypothetical particles passing through ordinary matter almost undetected. Despite decades of experiments, WIMPs remain undetected directly. Alternative proposals include axions—extremely light particles—or modifications to gravity itself rather than new particles.

The search continues through multiple approaches. Underground detectors attempt direct WIMP detection. Particle accelerators seek to create dark matter particles. Telescopes map dark matter distribution through gravitational effects. Each null result constrains possibilities, narrowing the search space.

Some question whether dark matter exists at all. Modified gravity theories propose that gravity behaves differently at galactic scales than Einstein predicted. However, these theories struggle to explain all observations that dark matter explains elegantly.

Dark matter represents humbling ignorance. We've identified 85% of matter's existence through gravitational effects yet remain fundamentally ignorant of its nature. The universe's primary constituent remains mysterious.

The passage primarily serves to

A) explain dark matter evidence, proposed explanations, and ongoing uncertainty
B) prove dark matter definitely exists
C) describe how galaxies rotate in detail
D) criticize scientists for not solving the problem

Galaxy rotation "like solid disks" is significant because it

A) proves galaxies are actually solid objects
B) suggests invisible mass distribution differs from visible matter
C) shows galaxies don't actually rotate
D) indicates galaxies are artificial constructs

Gravitational lensing provides dark matter evidence by

A) directly showing dark matter particles
B) revealing more mass than visible matter accounts for through light bending
C) creating dark matter in laboratories
D) proving gravity doesn't exist

Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations are relevant because they

A) created dark matter originally
B) prove ordinary matter cannot account for dark matter's mass
C) show dark matter is identical to ordinary matter
D) disprove Einstein's theories of gravity

WIMPs are challenging to detect because they

A) don't exist
B) interact weakly with ordinary matter
C) move too quickly to observe
D) are too large to measure

The phrase "humbling ignorance" suggests

A) scientists are incompetent
B) recognizing the limits of current knowledge about a major cosmic component
C) dark matter research should be abandoned
D) ignorance is preferable to knowledge


Questions 19–24: Humanities – Street Art
From Vandalism to Validation

Street art occupies an ambiguous cultural space—simultaneously celebrated in galleries and prosecuted as vandalism. This contradiction reveals tensions about art, public space, and who controls urban environments.

Graffiti emerged in 1970s New York as territorial marking and political expression by marginalized communities. Early graffiti writers "tagged" subway cars and buildings, creating elaborate lettering styles that became increasingly sophisticated. Authorities viewed this as vandalism; participants viewed it as reclaiming public space from which they'd been excluded.

The art world's embrace of street art began in the 1980s when artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat transitioned from street tagging to gallery exhibitions. This mainstream acceptance created controversy within graffiti communities. Some viewed gallery representation as selling out—abandoning street art's oppositional stance for commercial success. Others saw it as deserved recognition for genuine artistic skill.

Banksy epitomizes these tensions. His politically charged stenciled images appear illegally on public walls, critiquing capitalism, war, and surveillance. Yet his works sell for millions at auction. When a Banksy piece appeared on a building, property owners faced dilemmas: remove "vandalism" or preserve valuable art? Some cut entire walls from buildings to sell Banksy pieces—commercializing art created in opposition to commercialization.

Street art raises fundamental questions about public space. In democratic societies, who decides what appears in shared environments? Property owners argue they control their walls. Street artists argue that omnipresent corporate advertising occupies public consciousness without consent, making unsanctioned art a form of resistance. If Coca-Cola can paint our visual landscape with logos, why can't artists paint meaningful images?

Legal and cultural status varies internationally. In some cities, designated walls welcome street art. Others prosecute all unauthorized marking. This patchwork reflects unresolved debates about art's definition, public space ownership, and whether breaking laws for artistic expression merits tolerance.

The irony persists: museums exhibit photographs of street art in exhibitions about "outsider art," while cities pressure-wash the originals. Society simultaneously celebrates street art's authenticity and criminalizes the authentic act of creating it illegally.

The passage is primarily concerned with

A) teaching graffiti techniques
B) examining contradictions in how society values street art
C) arguing all graffiti should be legal
D) describing Banksy's biography

Early graffiti writers viewed tagging as

A) vandalism deserving punishment
B) meaningless destruction
C) reclaiming public space from which they'd been excluded
D) preparation for gallery careers

The controversy over gallery representation suggests that

A) all street artists want gallery shows
B) commercial success can conflict with street art's oppositional origins
C) galleries refuse to show graffiti
D) street art has no artistic merit

Property owners' dilemmas regarding Banksy pieces reveal

A) confusion about insurance policies
B) the tension between vandalism prosecution and valuable art preservation
C) unanimous agreement that street art is vandalism
D) lack of appreciation for art

The comparison to corporate advertising suggests street artists believe that

A) advertising is generally ethical
B) Coca-Cola should sponsor street art
C) if commercial messages occupy public space without consent, artistic expression should be similarly permitted
D) corporations create better art than individuals

"Outsider art" exhibitions photographing street art that cities remove is ironic because

A) photography is expensive
B) museums have poor lighting
C) society values street art institutionally while criminalizing its authentic illegal creation
D) photographers don't get permission


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Nuclear Energy
Passage 1

Climate change demands rapid decarbonization. Renewable energy alone cannot achieve necessary emissions reductions quickly enough. Nuclear power—carbon-free, reliable, and proven—must be part of the solution.

Solar and wind face intermittency problems. The sun doesn't always shine; wind doesn't always blow. Battery storage helps but remains expensive and insufficient for multi-day storage needs. Nuclear provides consistent baseload power regardless of weather, complementing renewables effectively.

Modern reactor designs address safety concerns. Fukushima resulted from outdated technology vulnerable to natural disasters. New designs feature passive safety systems that don't require operator intervention or external power. They cannot experience meltdowns like Chernobyl or Fukushima.

Waste concerns are overstated. Nuclear waste volume is tiny compared to fossil fuel pollution. One person's lifetime electricity from nuclear produces waste fitting in a soda can. Reprocessing technologies can reduce waste further while extracting more energy. Long-term storage is solvable through geological repositories.

France generates 70% of electricity from nuclear, achieving low emissions and reliable power. Their success demonstrates nuclear viability. Rejecting nuclear based on outdated fears means accepting slower climate action and continued fossil fuel dependence.

Passage 2

Nuclear power's climate benefits are undermined by its costs, risks, and timeline. We don't have decades for new nuclear plants while cheaper, faster alternatives exist.

Nuclear plants take 10–15 years to build and cost billions. Vogtle's recent Georgia reactors cost $30 billion—double initial estimates—and took 14 years. That money could have funded massive renewable deployment with storage, achieving greater emissions reductions faster.

"Modern safe reactors" remain largely hypothetical. Few next-generation designs have been built commercially. Relying on unproven technology while proven renewables exist is risky. Even modern reactors face challenges: uranium mining's environmental impact, thermal pollution, and vulnerability to climate change—droughts threaten cooling water supplies.

Waste disposal remains unsolved. No country has successfully implemented permanent high-level waste storage. "Geological repositories" sound simple but face enormous technical and political challenges. The U.S. abandoned Yucca Mountain after decades and billions spent. Waste accumulates at reactor sites indefinitely.

France's nuclear dependence creates vulnerabilities. In 2022, drought and maintenance issues forced unprecedented reactor shutdowns, creating energy crises. Centralized nuclear systems are less resilient than distributed renewable networks.

Renewables plus storage have dropped dramatically in cost and improve continuously. Nuclear costs remain high or increase. Betting on expensive, slow nuclear diverts resources from solutions deployable today.

Both passages would likely agree that

A) nuclear energy produces zero emissions during operation
B) renewable energy is largely sufficient on its own
C) cost is irrelevant to energy policy
D) France has abandoned nuclear power

Passage 1 emphasizes intermittency to argue that

A) solar and wind are largely ineffective
B) nuclear provides reliable baseload power complementing renewable limitations
C) batteries are unlikely to improve significantly
D) weather is unpredictable

How would Passage 2 respond to Passage 1's claims about modern reactor safety?

A) By agreeing substantially
B) By noting most designs remain hypothetical and unproven commercially
C) By denying safety improvements exist
D) By arguing safety is irrelevant

Unlike Passage 1, Passage 2 emphasizes

A) carbon emissions
B) France's energy system
C) construction timelines and costs compared to renewable alternatives
D) waste volume relative to fossil fuels

Passage 1 would likely respond to Passage 2's cost arguments by

A) admitting nuclear is too expensive
B) arguing that climate urgency justifies costs and that proven low-carbon technology matters more than speed alone
C) agreeing renewables are superior in every respect
D) denying that nuclear plants are expensive

The passages' relationship is best described as

A) Passage 1 advocates nuclear as a climate solution; Passage 2 questions its practicality and cost-effectiveness
B) Both passages oppose nuclear power
C) Both passages support nuclear power
D) They discuss different energy sources without overlap
