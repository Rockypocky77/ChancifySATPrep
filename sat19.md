SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


Read the passage and answer the questions.


The Last Library Card


I found the card at the back of my desk drawer, buried under dried-out pens and permission slips from years ago. It was pale blue, the corners softened, my name written in my mother's careful handwriting. The barcode sticker was peeling, as if the card had been trying to escape along with me.


When I was eight, this card meant freedom. Every Saturday, my mother and I walked to the library and carried home more books than made sense for a child who could barely see over the circulation desk. The librarians knew us by name; they would point out new arrivals as if we were VIPs at some quiet, paper-scented premiere.


High school changed that. Homework crowded my evenings, and my phone crowded everything else. I began reading summaries instead of stories, posts instead of pages. The library, once part of the weekly rhythm of my life, became just another building we drove past on the way to somewhere else.


Now, holding the card again, I felt a small, unreasonable guilt—like I'd ignored a friend's messages for years and was suddenly thinking of calling back. I traced the fading letters of my name, remembering how proud I'd been the day the librarian slid the card across the desk and said, "This makes you officially a reader."


I slipped the card into my wallet, next to my student ID and bus pass. Maybe it wouldn't change anything. Maybe I'd stay busy and tired and distracted. But as I closed the drawer, I still found myself thinking about the library's quiet aisles, still arranged in the same patient order, waiting for someone with a pale blue card to walk through the doors.


The passage primarily focuses on the narrator


A) regretting losing a library book and facing replacement fees.


B) recalling how a library card once symbolized freedom and considering returning to the library.


C) arguing that phones should be banned from schools and restricted from classrooms.


D) deciding to volunteer at the local library and community service.


Which sentence best supports the answer to Question 1?


A) "It was pale blue, the corners softened, my name written in my mother's careful handwriting."


B) "When I was eight, this card meant freedom."


C) "High school changed that."


D) "But as I closed the drawer, I still found myself thinking about the library's quiet aisles, still arranged in the same patient order, waiting for someone with a pale blue card to walk through the doors."


The narrator's feelings about reading in high school can best be described as


A) more distracted and pressured than in childhood.


B) more enthusiastic and focused than before with increased engagement.


C) unchanged from when they were eight.


D) indifferent in childhood and high school.


The phrase "paper-scented premiere" (paragraph 2) is used mainly to


A) criticize the library for being old-fashioned.


B) emphasize how glamorous the library felt to the narrator.


C) suggest that the library was too crowded.


D) describe a movie theater near the library.


The "small, unreasonable guilt" in paragraph 4 is based on the narrator's sense that


A) they stole library books as a child.


B) they forgot to return their library card.


C) they abandoned a place that once mattered deeply to them.


D) the librarians were rude to them.


The final sentence ("…waiting for someone with a pale blue card to walk through the doors") primarily suggests that


A) the library has closed permanently.


B) the narrator expects someone else to start reading.


C) the library remains available if the narrator chooses to return.


D) library cards are now obsolete.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


Sleep and School Start Times


Many high school students wake up when it is still dark, rushing through breakfast—or skipping it entirely—before catching early buses. Research on adolescent sleep, however, suggests that these routines may conflict with teenagers' biological clocks. During puberty, the body's internal rhythm shifts so that teenagers naturally fall asleep later and wake up later than younger children or adults.


When schools start too early, many students simply do not get enough sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to difficulty concentrating, irritability, and increased risk of anxiety and depression. It can also affect physical health by weakening the immune system and disrupting metabolism.


Some districts have responded by pushing high school start times later in the morning. Studies of these changes have found that students often report feeling more alert in class and that attendance and graduation rates sometimes improve. Critics worry about logistical challenges—such as bus schedules, after-school jobs, and sports practices—but supporters argue that teenagers' health should be a priority.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that all homework should be eliminated.


B) explain how adolescent sleep patterns relate to school start times.


C) describe the history of buses in school districts.


D) instruct teenagers on how to fall asleep earlier.


According to the passage, one consequence of early school start times is that


A) students always eat a large breakfast.


B) teenagers may not get enough sleep.


C) adults are more tired than teenagers.


D) school buses are less crowded.


The passage suggests that later school start times may lead to


A) improved student alertness and, in some cases, better attendance.


B) lower graduation rates.


C) no change in student behavior.


D) an increase in school suspensions.


Which sentence best supports the idea that sleep affects students' mental health?


A) "Many high school students wake up when it is still dark…"


B) "Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to difficulty concentrating, irritability, and increased risk of anxiety and depression."


C) "Some districts have responded by pushing high school start times later in the morning."


D) "Critics worry about logistical challenges…"


The author's attitude toward later start times is best described as


A) strongly opposed.


B) cautiously supportive, acknowledging both benefits and challenges.


C) indifferent to school policy.


D) focused only on bus schedules.


Which concern is mentioned by critics of later start times?


A) The cost of building new schools


B) Complications with transportation and after-school activities


C) A lack of scientific evidence


D) Students spending too much time at the library


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


Light Intensity and Plant Growth


A group of students investigated how light intensity affected the growth of a certain houseplant. They placed identical plants in four rooms with different average light levels but kept temperature, water, and soil type the same. After six weeks, they measured the average height of the plants in each room.


The results were:


 • Room A: low light (100 units) → 12 cm average height


 • Room B: moderate light (300 units) → 20 cm average height


 • Room C: bright light (600 units) → 27 cm average height


 • Room D: very bright light (900 units) → 25 cm average height


Based on the data, the students concluded that the plants grew taller in brighter light up to a point, but extremely high light intensity did not increase growth and might even slightly reduce it.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) describe an experiment on how light intensity influences plant growth.


B) argue that all houseplants should be kept in shade.


C) compare different soil types.


D) explain how to build a light meter.


Between which two rooms is the largest increase in average plant height observed?


A) Room A and Room B


B) Room B and Room C


C) Room C and Room D


D) Room A and Room C


Compared with Room C, Room D's average plant height is


A) 2 cm taller.


B) 2 cm shorter.


C) 5 cm taller.


D) 5 cm shorter.


Which statement is best supported by the data?


A) Plants always grow taller as light intensity increases.


B) Plants in moderate and bright light grow better than in low light, but extremely bright light does not provide additional benefits.


C) Plants grow tallest in low light.


D) Light intensity has no effect on plant growth.


If the students added a Room E with slightly dimmer light than Room A, which outcome would be most consistent with the pattern?


A) Plants in Room E would grow much taller than in Room C.


B) Plants in Room E would likely be shorter than those in Room A.


C) Plants in Room E would be exactly 27 cm tall.


D) Plants in Room E would not grow at all.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that extremely high light may slightly reduce growth?


A) "They placed identical plants in four rooms with different average light levels…"


B) "Room C: bright light (600 units) → 27 cm average height."


C) "Room D: very bright light (900 units) → 25 cm average height."


D) "Based on the data, the students concluded that the plants grew taller in brighter light up to a point…"


If these results were plotted on a graph with light intensity on the horizontal axis and plant height on the vertical axis, the point for Room B would be


A) (100, 12)


B) (300, 20)


C) (600, 27)


D) (900, 25)


The conclusion that "extremely high light intensity did not increase growth and might even slightly reduce it" is supported mainly by comparing


A) Room A and Room B.


B) Room B and Room C.


C) Room C and Room D.


D) Room A and Room E.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages – Handwriting and Typing Notes


Passage 1


In many classrooms, laptops have replaced notebooks as the default tool for taking notes. Typing is undeniably fast; students can record nearly every word a teacher says. Yet some researchers argue that this very speed can be a disadvantage. When note-taking becomes a race to capture language verbatim, students may pay less attention to ideas and more attention to the keyboard.


Handwriting, by contrast, is slower. Because students cannot write down everything, they must decide what matters most. This process of selecting, summarizing, and rephrasing can deepen understanding. Several studies have found that students who take handwritten notes often perform better on conceptual questions, even if those notes are shorter.


Passage 2


Advocates of digital note-taking emphasize benefits that go beyond speed. Typed notes are searchable, easy to back up, and simple to share with classmates. For students with certain learning differences, typing may be more comfortable than handwriting and can reduce physical strain. In addition, laptops allow students to integrate diagrams, links, and online resources directly into their notes.


However, digital notes also invite distractions: notifications, social media, and unrelated websites are only a click away. Some instructors therefore encourage a blended approach—allowing laptops but teaching students how to use them intentionally, rather than reflexively recording every word.


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) typing is always better than handwriting.


B) handwriting should be banned from classrooms.


C) each note-taking method has advantages and disadvantages.


D) students should not take notes in class.


Passage 1 suggests that one benefit of handwriting notes is that it


A) allows students to record every word spoken.


B) forces students to prioritize and process information.


C) eliminates the need to study later.


D) prevents all distractions.


Passage 2 emphasizes that a key advantage of typed notes is that they


A) are always more accurate than handwritten notes.


B) can be searched, backed up, and shared easily.


C) require no electricity.


D) are automatically free of distractions.


Which sentence from Passage 1 best supports the idea that handwritten notes can improve understanding?


A) "Typing is undeniably fast…"


B) "Yet some researchers argue that this very speed can be a disadvantage."


C) "Handwriting, by contrast, is slower."


D) "This process of selecting, summarizing, and rephrasing can deepen understanding."


Passage 2 notes that one challenge of digital note-taking is


A) difficulty reading typed text.


B) limited storage capacity.


C) the temptation to become distracted by non-class activities.


D) the lack of internet access in schools.


Both passages would most likely support which classroom policy?


A) Allowing only laptops and banning all paper


B) Allowing only handwriting and banning all devices


C) Teaching students how to choose and use note-taking tools thoughtfully


D) Having no guidelines for note-taking


In Passage 1, the phrase "race to capture language verbatim" most nearly suggests that


A) students carefully analyze every sentence.


B) students are competing to memorize the material.


C) students rush to type words without fully processing their meaning.


D) teachers speak too slowly.


In Passage 2, the mention of students with "certain learning differences" serves mainly to


A) argue that laptops should be used only in special education classes.


B) show that typing can make note-taking more accessible for some students.


C) prove that handwriting is harmful.


D) explain why sharing notes is dangerous.


What is the relationship between the two passages?


A) Passage 1 criticizes all technology, and Passage 2 defends it without reservation.


B) Passage 1 and Passage 2 present different perspectives on note-taking methods, highlighting benefits and drawbacks of both.


C) Passage 1 and Passage 2 discuss unrelated topics.


D) Passage 1 explains research, while Passage 2 is fictional.


On which proposal would the authors of both passages most likely disagree?


A) Encouraging students to reflect on how they take notes


B) Allowing both laptops and notebooks in class


C) Banning laptops entirely in all college lectures


D) Teaching strategies for effective note-taking
