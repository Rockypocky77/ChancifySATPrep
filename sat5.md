SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)

Questions 1–6: Literature – Identity and Belonging
The Translation

My name is Yuki, but here everyone calls me Julie. The transformation happened on my first day at Morrison Elementary—the teacher glanced at my name tag, frowned, and said, "That's difficult. How about Julie? It's close enough."

I was seven. I didn't know I could say no.

At home, I remained Yuki. My grandmother, who lived with us and spoke minimal English, would call "Yuki-chan!" and I'd help her fold laundry or shell edamame. At school, Julie raised her hand in math class and ate peanut butter sandwiches, which I'd learned to request instead of onigiri because Emma had wrinkled her nose at my lunch last week.

The split felt manageable until the fifth-grade heritage project. We were supposed to present our family backgrounds. Most kids showed Ellis Island documents or talked about Irish or Italian grandparents. I prepared carefully—photos of Tokyo, a kimono my grandmother had kept, some of her calligraphy.

"That's so cool," Emma said afterward. "You're like, basically Japanese."

Basically. As if it were approximate, diluted, not quite authentic because I'd been born in Sacramento and my English had no accent.

That night, I asked my grandmother to teach me more Japanese. She looked pleased but puzzled—I'd resisted lessons for years, frustrated by the difficulty, by how the language felt foreign in my mouth despite my face.

"Yuki-chan ga nihon-jin ni naritai?" she asked. Did I want to become Japanese?

The question exposed the problem: I was trying to become what I already was supposed to be, what I looked like but didn't quite feel like, caught between two languages and fully fluent in neither.

Now, at seventeen, I've reclaimed Yuki. I correct teachers on the first day. I study Japanese seriously. I've learned that identity isn't either/or—not a translation where something gets lost, but more like a bridge connecting places, strong precisely because it spans distance.

But sometimes I still feel the split: Yuki and Julie, both me, both true, both incomplete alone.

Questions 7–12: Social Science – The Bystander Effect
When Many Watch, Few Help

In 1964, Kitty Genovese was murdered in New York while, according to initial reports, 38 witnesses watched without intervening. The case catalyzed research into the "bystander effect"—the phenomenon where individuals are less likely to help victims when other people are present.

Psychologists John Darley and Bibb Latané conducted experiments testing this counterintuitive finding. In one study, participants believed they were discussing personal problems with other students via intercom. When one student (actually a confederate) feigned a seizure, participants alone with the victim helped 85% of the time. With four other "bystanders" present, only 31% helped.

The bystander effect operates through multiple mechanisms. Diffusion of responsibility: with many witnesses, each individual feels less personal obligation—"someone else will help." Pluralistic ignorance: people look to others for cues about appropriate behavior; when everyone appears unconcerned, individuals interpret the situation as non-emergency. Social influence: fear of appearing foolish or overreacting inhibits action, especially when others remain passive.

However, recent research complicates this narrative. Meta-analyses find bystander effects are stronger in laboratory settings than real-world scenarios. Analysis of security camera footage from public spaces shows bystanders intervene in conflicts and emergencies at surprisingly high rates—over 90% in some studies. Dangerous situations actually prompted more intervention, not less, contradicting assumptions that danger inhibits helping.

The Genovese case itself deserves scrutiny. Subsequent investigations revealed the "38 witnesses" claim was exaggerated. Many residents heard something but couldn't see what was happening. Some did call police. The story became mythological, perhaps because it confirmed unsettling suspicions about urban alienation and moral decline.

Context matters profoundly. In ambiguous situations—is that person sick or drunk? Are those people fighting or playing?—bystander effects strengthen. In clear emergencies, intervention increases. Group dynamics vary: strangers show stronger bystander effects than groups of friends or community members. Cultural factors influence helping behavior; collectivist societies show weaker bystander effects than individualist ones.

Understanding these dynamics has practical implications. Teaching people about diffusion of responsibility can counteract it. Emergency training programs emphasize directly addressing individuals—"You in the red shirt, call 911"—which overcomes diffusion effects. Public awareness campaigns can establish helping norms.

The bystander effect represents important psychological insight but shouldn't justify cynicism about human nature. Under specific conditions, group presence inhibits helping. Under others, it facilitates coordinated response. The goal is creating conditions that enable our better instincts.

A) describe the bystander effect's mechanisms and note recent research complicating simple narratives
B) prove humans are inherently selfish
C) describe one historical murder
D) argue bystander effects don't exist

The Darley and Latané experiment demonstrated that

Questions 13–18: Natural Science – Antibiotic Resistance
The Evolution We're Losing

Alexander Fleming's 1928 discovery of penicillin inaugurated the antibiotic age, transforming previously deadly infections into treatable conditions. Within decades, common infections, surgical complications, and diseases like tuberculosis became manageable. Now, less than a century later, antibiotic resistance threatens to render these miracle drugs obsolete.

Resistance emerges through natural selection operating at extraordinary speed. Bacterial populations are vast—a single infection might contain billions of bacteria. Within any population, random mutations create genetic variation. Most mutations are neutral or harmful, but occasionally one confers antibiotic resistance.

When antibiotics enter the environment, they create intense selection pressure. Susceptible bacteria die; resistant ones survive and reproduce. Since bacteria divide rapidly—some species doubling every twenty minutes—resistant populations explode quickly. A single resistant bacterium can produce over a million descendants in hours.

Resistance mechanisms vary. Some bacteria produce enzymes degrading antibiotics. Others modify cellular targets so antibiotics can't bind. Some develop efflux pumps actively expelling antibiotics. Alarmingly, bacteria share resistance genes horizontally through plasmids—circular DNA fragments transferred between organisms, even across species. A resistance gene emerging in one bacterial species can spread to unrelated pathogens rapidly.

Human practices accelerate resistance evolution. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics—taking them for viral infections they can't treat, stopping treatment prematurely, agricultural use for growth promotion—increase selection pressure. Every antibiotic exposure is an evolutionary opportunity for resistance.

Consequences are mounting. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes infections resisting multiple antibiotics. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) show resistance to "last resort" drugs. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis requires lengthy treatment with toxic drugs and still has low cure rates. The CDC estimates antibiotic-resistant infections cause 35,000 US deaths annually.

Solutions require systemic changes. Antibiotic stewardship programs aim to reduce unnecessary prescriptions. Rapid diagnostic tests can distinguish bacterial from viral infections, preventing inappropriate antibiotic use. Agriculture is reducing routine antibiotic use in livestock. Research pursues alternatives: bacteriophages (viruses attacking bacteria), immunotherapies, and novel antimicrobials with new mechanisms.

The deeper challenge is biological. We're racing against evolution itself. Every new antibiotic eventually selects for resistance. Unless we fundamentally change our relationship with these drugs—using them judiciously, developing alternatives, accepting that not every infection requires antibiotics—we risk returning to a pre-antibiotic era where minor infections again become life-threatening.

The passage primarily aims to

A) explain how antibiotic resistance evolves and threatens modern medicine

Questions 19–24: Humanities – The Economics of Art
What Is Art Worth?

In 2017, Leonardo da Vinci's "Salvator Mundi" sold for $450 million—the highest price ever paid for artwork. In 2019, Maurizio Cattelan's "Comedian"—a banana duct-taped to a wall—sold for $120,000. These transactions raise uncomfortable questions: What determines art's value? Who decides? And why do these answers matter beyond art world elites?

Traditional art valuation considers factors like historical significance, artist reputation, provenance, rarity, and aesthetic quality. Old Masters command premiums because few survive; their historical importance is established; their scarcity is absolute. By these metrics, high Leonardo prices make sense.

But contemporary art valuation operates differently. Living artists can produce unlimited works. Historical significance is speculative. Aesthetic quality is radically subjective—one person's profound statement is another's pretentious nonsense. Yet contemporary art drives the market, with works selling for millions.

Economic theory provides partial explanation. Art functions as a Veblen good—a product whose desirability increases with price. Expensive art signals wealth and status. Purchasing a $10 million painting demonstrates resources and cultural capital in ways accessible purchases cannot. The art itself matters less than what ownership communicates socially.

Investment dynamics complicate matters further. Art markets attract investors seeking assets uncorrelated with stock markets. During economic uncertainty, art can appreciate while equities decline. This transforms art into financial instruments—derivatives of cultural production valued for portfolio diversification rather than aesthetic experience.

Critics argue this financialization corrupts art's purpose. Art becomes a wealth storage vehicle for the ultra-rich rather than cultural expression enriching society. Museums increasingly cannot afford major works, which disappear into private collections or climate-controlled storage facilities functioning as high-security safety deposit boxes. The public loses access to cultural heritage.

The banana artwork epitomizes these tensions. Cattelan's piece satirizes art market absurdity—its humor lies partly in its ridiculous price. Yet someone paid $120,000, validating the market it mocks. Is it brilliant meta-commentary or expensive joke? The question's unanswerability is perhaps the point.

Alternative art economies exist. Community art centers provide accessible creative spaces. Public art escapes market commodification. Digital art and NFTs (despite their own speculative bubbles) demonstrate new distribution models. Street art operates entirely outside conventional markets, though paradoxically, its anti-establishment cachet eventually attracts collectors and galleries.

Ultimately, art's value is socially constructed—determined not by inherent qualities but by complex interactions between creators, critics, institutions, collectors, and markets. There's no "true" value independent of these systems. This doesn't make art valueless—it means value emerges through cultural negotiation rather than objective measurement.

The question isn't whether expensive art is "worth" its price in absolute terms—that's unanswerable. It's whether current valuation systems serve art's broader social functions: fostering creativity, enabling expression, providing aesthetic experience, preserving culture. By those measures, a system where most art funding flows toward speculative investment while community programs struggle seems misaligned with art's purposes.

The passage primarily examines

A) art history chronologically
B) factors determining art value and tensions between aesthetic, social, and financial valuations
C) painting techniques
D) museum architecture

A) it's produced by Veblen
B) desirability increases with price because cost signals wealth and status
C) it's generally affordable
D) quality improves with price

"Financialization" of art refers to

A) financial assistance for artists
B) treating art as investment instruments valued for portfolio performance rather than aesthetic experience
C) art depicting money
D) affordable prices

Cattelan's banana artwork is described as paradoxical because

A) bananas aren't art materials
B) it satirizes market absurdity yet someone paid substantially, validating what it mocks
C) it's yellow
D) duct tape is expensive

Alternative art economies like community centers and public art are mentioned as

A) inferior approaches
B) examples of art practices outside conventional commodification markets
C) more expensive
D) unsuccessful models

The passage's concluding argument suggests art valuation systems should be evaluated by

A) maximizing prices
B) whether they serve art's broader social functions like fostering creativity and providing public access
C) excluding public participation
D) restricting museum access


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – College Admissions Testing
Passage 1

Standardized testing has dominated college admissions for decades, but growing numbers of institutions are adopting test-optional policies. This shift recognizes that SAT and ACT scores correlate more strongly with family income than college success.

Research consistently shows wealthier students score higher—not because they're smarter but because they access better schools, test prep, and opportunities. Students from families earning over $200,000 annually average SAT scores 300+ points higher than students from families earning under $20,000. This isn't measuring academic potential—it's measuring socioeconomic privilege.

Test-optional advocates argue holistic admissions better evaluate students. High school GPA, considering course rigor and school context, predicts college performance more accurately than test scores. Essays, recommendations, and activities reveal character, resilience, and potential in ways multiple-choice tests cannot.

Critics claim test-optional policies mask grade inflation and allow subjective bias. But this assumes tests are objective. In reality, tests reflect specific cultural knowledge and familiarity with abstract problem formats disconnected from actual college coursework. A student who hasn't encountered certain vocabulary because English isn't their first language or who hasn't learned test-taking strategies isn't less intelligent—they're less test-prepared.

Test-optional success stories are emerging. Bowdoin College adopted test-optional admissions in 1969 and found no difference in college performance between submitters and non-submitters. Studies across hundreds of test-optional institutions show similar results—students without test scores succeed at equal rates.

Equity improves under test-optional policies. More first-generation college students, students of color, and low-income students apply and enroll. This isn't lowering standards—it's broadening access to talented students previously excluded by artificial barriers.

Passage 2

Test-optional policies, despite good intentions, may harm the students they aim to help while obscuring actual academic preparedness.

Standardized tests provide imperfect but useful data. Yes, scores correlate with income, but they also correlate with academic preparation independent of income. Controlling for socioeconomic factors, test scores still predict college performance—not perfectly, but meaningfully. Discarding useful predictive information doesn't serve students.

High school GPA seems fairer but introduces problems tests were designed to solve. Grade inflation varies dramatically between schools. An A at a well-resourced suburban school differs from an A at an underfunded rural school, yet transcripts don't indicate this. Tests, whatever their flaws, provide standardized comparison points.

Holistic admissions sound appealing but enable subjective preferences. Without standardized metrics, admissions become more influenced by factors like interviewing skills, extracurricular opportunities requiring resources, and counselor relationships—all advantages of privilege. Studies show that removing objective criteria often increases rather than decreases bias.

Test-optional policies paradoxically may disadvantage low-income students. High-achieving low-income students often have less impressive extracurriculars, weaker counselor relationships, and minimal test prep—but they can still achieve respectable scores. Without test scores, these students have fewer ways to demonstrate capability. Meanwhile, wealthy students with mediocre scores simply don't submit them while their polished applications shine.

Evidence from test-optional schools requires scrutiny. Many students not submitting scores wouldn't have qualified for admission anyway—they're not displacing anyone. And tracking students through college doesn't address selection effects—students confident enough to apply without scores may be systematically different in unmeasured ways.

Rather than eliminating tests, reform them. Provide free test prep. Offer multiple testing dates. Use scores contextually, considering socioeconomic factors. Tests aren't perfect, but flawed data beats no data when making high-stakes decisions affecting students' futures.

Both passages would agree that

A) SAT scores perfectly predict success

B) problems with holistic admissions like grade inflation variation and potential for subjective bias
C) test-optional policies' benefits
D) student success stories

Passage 1 would respond to concerns about holistic admissions enabling bias by

A) agreeing tests are better
B) arguing current testing already reflects privilege and holistic review can consider context
C) denying bias exists
D) claiming objectivity is impossible

B) Passage 1 argues test-optional improves equity; Passage 2 argues standardized tests provide valuable data and test-optional may harm intended beneficiaries
C) both oppose test-optional policies
D) they reach identical conclusions
