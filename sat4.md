SAT PRACTICE TEST 4

SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)

---

**Question 1**

The lawyer's office smelled like old paper and decisions that couldn't be undone. My sister Jenna sat across from me, her expression unreadable. "Your father's estate," the lawyer began. Dad had taught me to ride a bike and burned pancakes every Sunday—but the last decade had hollowed him out, gradually, the way rivers reshape stone. The will was straightforward: house to Jenna, investments to me. Equal value, the lawyer assured us, as if value could be measured only in dollars.

The passage primarily explores

A) legal procedures governing property distribution in estate settlements
B) the narrator's experience of regret and incomplete understanding of their father
C) competitive financial dynamics between siblings over inheritance
D) real estate market conditions affecting inherited property values

---

**Question 2**

Jenna had stayed. She'd visited every week, endured the repetitive conversations as dementia erased him piece by piece. I'd moved across the country for a job, for a life, for reasons that seemed important at the time. Now, sitting in the lawyer's office, those reasons felt thin—excuses I'd constructed to justify absence while my sister shouldered the weight of watching our father disappear.

The description of dementia "erasing him piece by piece" suggests

A) the availability of effective therapeutic interventions for cognitive decline
B) the gradual dissolution of the father's identity and memory over time
C) primarily physical rather than cognitive symptoms of the aging process
D) typical memory lapses that occur normally during healthy aging

---

**Question 3**

We divided his belongings over the next week. The process was archaeological—layers of a life we'd only partly known. Photos of a young man we'd never met. Letters from a war he'd never discussed. A journal with entries that stopped abruptly in 1987, the year our mother left. Each discovery revealed how little we'd asked, how much we'd assumed, how incomplete our understanding of him had always been.

As used in the passage, "archaeological" most nearly means

A) relating to the scientific study of ancient civilizations
B) requiring specialized training in excavation techniques
C) the process of uncovering hidden layers of someone's past
D) characterized by precise measurement and documentation

---

**Question 4**

"The house needs work. Roof, probably plumbing. Your investments are cleaner," Jenna said. Cleaner. As if guilt came off with soap and water. She'd inherited the physical burden of a deteriorating house; I'd inherited abstract numbers on statements I'd never need to visit. She'd have to walk through rooms where Dad had lived and faded; I'd never have to confront those spaces at all.

Jenna's comment that investments are "cleaner" implies that

A) financial assets require minimal ongoing maintenance and attention
B) monetary investments have higher economic value than real estate
C) financial inheritance lacks the emotional complications of physical property
D) liquid assets provide greater flexibility in estate planning

The journal stopping in 1987 is significant because

A) that year corresponds to the mother's departure from the family
B) written journal-keeping practices had become obsolete by that period
C) the father ceased engaging in creative writing activities at that time
D) 1987 represented a historically significant year with broader cultural implications

The final paragraph suggests the true inheritance is

A) the physical property and residential structure
B) the financial assets and monetary resources
C) the psychological weight of unresolved questions and partial comprehension regarding their father's life
D) photographic documentation of family history


Questions 7–12: Social Science – Sleep Debt
The Cumulative Cost of Insufficient Sleep

Sleep deprivation's immediate effects are well-documented: impaired cognition, slower reaction times, mood disturbances. Less understood is sleep debt—the cumulative deficit accrued over time—and whether it can be fully repaid.

Research distinguishes between acute and chronic sleep deprivation. Acute deprivation—pulling an all-nighter—produces dramatic but largely reversible impairments. One or two recovery nights restore most functioning. Chronic deprivation—consistently sleeping six hours nightly instead of needed eight—operates more insidiously.

Studies tracking chronic partial sleep restriction found that six-hour sleepers showed progressive cognitive decline over two weeks, eventually matching performance of those who'd been completely sleep-deprived for two days. Alarmingly, participants reported only moderate sleepiness, suggesting impaired self-assessment—they couldn't recognize their own deterioration.

Can sleep debt be repaid? Weekend "catch-up" sleep partially helps. Sleeping ten hours on weekends after five-hour weeknight sleep reduces some impairments. However, research suggests full recovery requires extended restoration. One study found three weeks of recovery sleep necessary to reverse two weeks of restriction—a three-to-two ratio suggesting sleep debt accrues faster than it's repaid.

Chronic sleep restriction may cause permanent changes. Animal studies show prolonged sleep deprivation damages brain cells and weakens synaptic connections. Some cognitive effects persisted even after extended recovery periods. While human research remains incomplete, evidence suggests chronic sleep loss may have irreversible consequences.

Individual sleep needs vary genetically. Most adults require 7–9 hours, but rare genetic variants enable functioning on six hours without impairment. For most people, though, chronic restriction accumulates debt with compounding interest—each night's deficit making the next day's cognitive loan more expensive.

The passage's primary purpose is to

A) explain acute vs chronic sleep deprivation and questions about full recovery from sleep debt
B) argue everyone should sleep ten hours
C) describe dream research
D) prove sleep is unnecessary

Six-hour sleepers showing "progressive cognitive decline" demonstrates

A) six hours is generally sufficient
B) chronic partial restriction causes cumulative impairment over time
C) everyone needs the same sleep
D) cognitive tests are unreliable

Participants' "impaired self-assessment" is significant because

A) people were dishonest
B) chronically sleep-deprived individuals couldn't accurately recognize their own deterioration
C) sleepiness isn't measurable
D) surveys don't work

The three-to-two recovery ratio suggests

A) sleep debt is easily repaid
B) weekends restore all deficits
C) sleep debt accumulates more quickly than it's repaid
D) sleep doesn't matter

Animal studies showing persistent effects suggest

A) animals are different from humans
B) chronic sleep loss may cause some irreversible damage
C) all effects are permanent
D) sleep research is impossible

"Compounding interest" metaphorically means

A) financial investments
B) each night's deficit makes subsequent cognitive impairments progressively worse
C) interest rates
D) debt is beneficial


Questions 13–18: Natural Science – CRISPR Gene Editing
Rewriting the Code of Life

In 2012, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier published research on CRISPR-Cas9—a bacterial immune system repurposed as a gene-editing tool. The breakthrough's implications ripple through medicine, agriculture, and ethics.

CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) evolved as bacterial defense against viruses. When viruses attack bacteria, surviving bacteria incorporate viral DNA fragments into their genome. If the virus returns, bacteria use these stored sequences to recognize and destroy it—a primitive adaptive immune system.

The Cas9 protein acts as molecular scissors, cutting DNA at precise locations. Scientists can program CRISPR to target specific genes by providing guide RNA matching the target sequence. Once cut, cells repair DNA, and scientists can introduce desired changes during repair.

CRISPR's advantages over previous gene-editing methods include precision, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness. Earlier techniques required months and substantial funding. CRISPR experiments can be conducted in weeks for thousands rather than millions of dollars, democratizing genetic research.

Medical applications are emerging rapidly. Clinical trials treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia by editing patients' blood cells. Cancer immunotherapies engineer T-cells to attack tumors. Research targets cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and Huntington's disease.

Yet concerns mount. In 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced he'd edited human embryos to confer HIV resistance—resulting in twin girls. The scientific community condemned this premature application. Germline editing—changes passed to offspring—raises profound questions: Who decides which traits to edit? What constitutes disease versus difference? How do we prevent eugenic applications?

Off-target effects—unintended edits elsewhere in the genome—present technical challenges. While CRISPR's precision has improved, accidental modifications could cause unforeseen problems, especially in germline editing where mistakes propagate across generations.

CRISPR represents transformative power and sobering responsibility. The technology to reshape human biology has arrived faster than societal consensus on its appropriate use.

A) explains CRISPR's mechanism and discusses medical and ethical implications
B) argues against all gene editing
C) describes bacterial viruses primarily

A) missing the laboratory
B) unintended genetic modifications at unintended genome locations
C) targeting wrong diseases
D) cost overruns

The final sentence emphasizes

A) technological advancement
B) the gap between CRISPR capabilities and societal ethical consensus on its use
C) scientific achievement
D) future research


Questions 19–24: Humanities – The Museum's Dilemma
Artifacts, Ownership, and Colonial Legacy

Museums worldwide face intensifying pressure to return artifacts acquired during colonialism. The British Museum holds the Parthenon Marbles; the Smithsonian possesses Benin Bronzes; French museums house countless African artifacts. Demands for repatriation force difficult questions about cultural property, historical justice, and museums' purpose.

Traditional museum arguments for retention emphasize preservation and access. Many artifacts come from regions with political instability, inadequate conservation facilities, or limited resources. Museums argue they protect humanity's cultural heritage and provide global access—a British schoolchild can see Egyptian artifacts; a Japanese tourist can view Aztec relics.

This "universal museum" concept faces strong criticism. It conveniently serves institutions benefiting from colonial plunder while denying source communities their cultural patrimony. When Lord Elgin removed Parthenon sculptures in 1801, he had permission from Ottoman authorities—but not Greeks, whose subjugation made their consent impossible. Many African artifacts weren't purchased but seized during military expeditions.

Legal frameworks complicate matters. UNESCO's 1970 Convention addresses cultural property, but isn't retroactive—it doesn't cover artifacts acquired earlier. National laws vary widely. Museums often have legal title to disputed objects, but legal ownership doesn't resolve moral questions.

Recent developments suggest shifting attitudes. In 2021, France returned 26 artifacts to Benin. Germany committed to returning Benin Bronzes. The Smithsonian repatriated 29 Benin pieces. These cases establish precedents, though critics note the pace remains slow given the scale—European museums hold thousands of African artifacts.

Complications include cases where source countries have changed—artifacts from historically distinct regions now within modern nations. Sometimes multiple countries claim objects. Documentation gaps obscure provenance. Objects may have circulated through markets before museum acquisition, complicating responsibility chains.

Some propose long-term loans as compromise—artifacts legally remain with museums but physically return to source communities. Others argue this preserves colonial power dynamics rather than genuinely addressing them.

The repatriation debate ultimately asks: What are museums for? If their purpose includes education and preservation, can this justify possessing others' cultural heritage? Or does justice require returning objects regardless of practical considerations? These questions lack easy answers, but ignoring them is no longer tenable.

The passage primarily examines

A) museum architecture
B) debates over repatriating colonially-acquired artifacts including preservation, access, and justice arguments
C) tourism statistics
D) ancient art techniques

The "universal museum" concept argues that

A) all museums are identical
B) major museums protect and provide global access to cultural heritage
C) museums should close
D) artifacts belong nowhere

Critics challenge the universal museum concept by noting it

A) costs too much
B) conveniently justifies retaining colonially plundered artifacts while denying source communities their cultural heritage
C) prevents tourism
D) requires translation

UNESCO's 1970 Convention is limited because

A) it applies to all historical periods
B) it isn't retroactive so doesn't cover earlier colonial acquisitions
C) no countries ratified it
D) museums largely ignore it

Long-term loans are proposed as

A) financial arrangements
B) a compromise allowing physical return while maintaining legal museum ownership
C) permanent solutions
D) ways to increase tourism

The passage's final question emphasizes

A) museums' budgets
B) fundamental questions about museum purposes and whether practical benefits justify possessing others' cultural heritage
C) visitor attendance
D) architectural design


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Screen Time and Development
Passage 1

Alarm over children's screen time has reached moral panic levels. Recommendations urge strict limits: no screens under two, one hour maximum for children 2–5, two hours for older kids. These guidelines lack solid evidence and reflect technophobic bias rather than rigorous analysis.

Research claiming screen time harms children suffers methodological flaws. Studies rely on parental reports of screen time—notoriously inaccurate. Correlational designs can't establish causation. A child with behavioral problems might use screens more as coping mechanism rather than screens causing problems.

Meta-analyses find screen time's effects are modest at best. A major study analyzing 20,000 children found screen time explained less than 2% of variance in wellbeing—comparable to wearing glasses or eating potatoes. We don't panic about potato consumption, yet demonize screens.

Content and context matter more than duration. Educational programming differs from random YouTube videos. Co-viewing with engaged parents differs from solitary use. A child video-calling grandparents has different experiences than passively watching cartoons.

Historical parallels abound. Previous generations feared novels would corrupt youth, radio would rot brains, television would create violence. Each time, predictions of catastrophe proved exaggerated. Current screen panic follows this pattern—new technology triggers anxiety projected onto children.

Excessive restrictions may backfire. Children need to develop healthy media literacy and self-regulation. Overly controlling approaches prevent learning these skills and may increase rebellious excessive use when parental oversight decreases.

Passage 2

Dismissing screen time concerns as moral panic ignores accumulating evidence of genuine developmental impacts.

Brain imaging studies show excessive screen time correlates with thinned cortex in regions processing sensory information. Longitudinal research finds associations between early screen exposure and attention problems, language delays, and reduced social-emotional development.

The claim that effects are "modest" misunderstands developmental science. Small average effects can mask significant impacts on vulnerable children. A 2% variance doesn't mean screens harm everyone equally—some children show substantial effects while others show none. Developmental windows matter; early exposure during critical periods may cause lasting impacts even if later exposure doesn't.

Content matters, but duration does too. Even "educational" content for young children shows minimal learning benefits compared to human interaction. Infants learn words from live speakers far better than from videos—the "video deficit effect." Screens cannot replace three-dimensional exploration and responsive human interaction crucial for early development.

The potato comparison is absurd. Potatoes don't emit light suppressing melatonin and disrupting sleep. They don't deliver algorithmically optimized supernormal stimuli engineered to maximize engagement. Technology companies employ psychologists specifically to make products addictive—comparing this to vegetables is intellectually dishonest.

Historical parallels fail because previous technologies didn't occupy childhood at current scales. Television averaged 2–3 hours daily; modern children average 7+ hours across devices. Quantity changes quality. Additionally, technologies differ—reading novels requires active imagination; passive video consumption doesn't.

Moderate, informed restrictions differ from "overly controlling" approaches. Guiding children toward healthy patterns while explaining reasoning isn't authoritarian—it's responsible parenting. Self-regulation develops through guidance, not unrestricted access.

Both passages would agree that

A) screens should be largely restricted
B) content and context of screen use matters
C) all research is flawed
D) screens have no effects

Passage 1's argument that screen time effects are "modest" would be challenged by Passage 2 through

A) agreement
B) arguing that small average effects can mask significant impacts on vulnerable individuals during critical developmental windows
C) claiming all effects are massive
D) denying statistics exist

How would Passage 2 respond to the potato comparison?

A) Agree potatoes and screens are equivalent
B) Argue the comparison is absurd because screens have unique properties like melatonin suppression and algorithmic engagement optimization
C) Claim potatoes are more harmful
D) Ignore the comparison

Unlike Passage 1, Passage 2 emphasizes

A) historical patterns
B) brain imaging evidence and developmental science showing actual impacts
C) parental reports
D) meta-analyses primarily

Passage 1 would respond to brain imaging studies by likely

A) accepting all conclusions immediately
B) questioning whether correlations establish causation and whether alternative explanations exist
C) denying neuroscience exists
D) agreeing screens cause all problems

The passages' relationship:

A) both argue for unlimited screen time
B) Passage 1 minimizes screen time concerns as overblown; Passage 2 argues evidence supports genuine developmental impacts
C) both call for complete screen bans
D) they agree on all points
