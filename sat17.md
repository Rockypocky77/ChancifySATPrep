SAT PRACTICE TEST 17


SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


The Audition


The auditorium seats were mostly empty when I walked in, but my heart reacted as if the room were packed. The stage lights were already on, spilling a bright rectangle across the floor. A folding table sat in the front row where the directors would sit; right now it held only a stack of scripts and a half-finished cup of coffee.


"You're early," Ms. Reyes called from the stage. She was arranging three mismatched chairs into a triangle, then stepping back to see how they looked.


"I didn't want to be late," I replied, though that wasn't quite true. I had arrived early so that I could change my mind before anyone else showed up, in case the courage I'd gathered on the walk from the bus stop dissolved under the fluorescent lights.


Ms. Reyes hopped off the stage and joined me in the front row. "You brought a monologue?"


I nodded and held up the crumpled page I'd printed from the library. It was from a play none of my classmates had heard of, which felt safer than choosing a famous speech everyone would recognize. If I stumbled, maybe they wouldn't know.


"Good choice," she said, without even reading it. "Auditions are less about perfection and more about honesty. We just want to see what you do with the moment."


The idea of "honesty" onstage struck me as strange. I was about to pretend to be someone else, in a situation that had never happened, saying words I had not written. Yet as I stepped into the light, the empty seats became less important than the single question echoing in my mind: What if I actually belong here?


The passage primarily focuses on


A) a teacher forcing a student to join the drama club and mandatory participation.


B) a student deciding whether to go to college for theater and career choices.


C) a nervous student arriving early for an audition and questioning their place onstage.


D) the technical difficulties of running stage lights and equipment challenges.


Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?


A) "The auditorium seats were mostly empty when I walked in, but my heart reacted as if the room were packed."


B) "She was arranging three mismatched chairs into a triangle…"


C) "I had arrived early so that I could change my mind before anyone else showed up…"


D) "A folding table sat in the front row where the directors would sit…"


The narrator chooses a monologue from a play "none of my classmates had heard of" mainly because


A) the play is required reading for theater class.


B) the narrator wants to impress Ms. Reyes with a rare script.


C) the narrator hopes that mistakes will be less noticeable if others don't recognize the piece.


D) the play is shorter than all the others available.


The statement "Auditions are less about perfection and more about honesty" (paragraph 6) suggests that Ms. Reyes values


A) memorization over creativity.


B) emotional truth and genuine effort over flawless performance.


C) elaborate costumes over clear speaking.


D) strict obedience to the original script.


The contrast between the empty seats and the narrator's reaction in paragraph 1 serves mainly to


A) demonstrate that the auditorium is rarely used.


B) highlight the narrator's nervousness despite the lack of an audience.


C) show that the directors have not arrived on time.


D) suggest that the narrator is bored by the audition process.


The final question in the passage ("What if I actually belong here?") indicates that the narrator


A) is certain they will be cast in the lead role.


B) is considering quitting drama altogether.


C) is beginning to imagine that they might truly fit into the theater community.


D) regrets choosing the monologue.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


Group Projects and Fairness


Many students groan when teachers announce group projects. The complaints are familiar: one person does all the work, another disappears entirely, and everyone ends up sharing the same grade. These experiences can feel unfair, yet group assignments remain common in schools and workplaces.


Supporters argue that group projects help students practice collaboration skills they will need later in life. Few jobs involve working in complete isolation. Learning how to divide tasks, negotiate disagreements, and combine different strengths can prepare students for future careers.


Critics counter that poorly structured group projects can reward unequal effort. When teachers do not provide clear roles or check individual contributions, some students may rely on others to finish the work. This can cause frustration and encourage hard-working students to avoid group tasks whenever possible.


Some researchers suggest that the solution is not to eliminate group projects but to redesign them. Strategies include assigning specific responsibilities, using peer evaluations to inform grades, and asking students to reflect on their own contributions. These adjustments can help ensure that collaboration feels more fair and meaningful.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that all group projects should be banned.


B) describe common complaints about group projects and propose ways to improve them.


C) explain how to calculate grades for individual assignments.


D) compare group projects to standardized tests.


According to the passage, one benefit of group projects is that they


A) guarantee equal effort from every student.


B) teach students collaboration skills for future careers.


C) always result in higher grades for everyone.


D) make teachers' jobs easier.


The passage suggests that a major problem with many group projects is that


A) students do not have enough homework.


B) teachers never collect the work.


C) unclear roles can lead to some students doing much less than others.


D) students do not like working with friends.


Which sentence best supports the idea that group projects can feel unfair?


A) "Many students groan when teachers announce group projects."


B) "These experiences can feel unfair, yet group assignments remain common…"


C) "Few jobs involve working in complete isolation."


D) "Some researchers suggest that the solution is not to eliminate group projects…"


The author's attitude toward group projects is best described as


A) completely negative and opposed.


B) positive but unaware of any problems.


C) balanced, recognizing both benefits and drawbacks.


D) indifferent to whether they are used.


Which suggestion is presented as a way to improve group projects?


A) Assigning specific responsibilities to group members


B) Allowing only individual assignments


C) Letting one student choose everyone's grade


D) Reducing the number of classes in a school day


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


Enzyme Activity and Temperature


A student investigated how temperature affects the activity of a particular enzyme that helps break down starch. The student mixed starch and the enzyme in four separate test tubes and placed each tube in a water bath at a different temperature. After ten minutes, the student measured how much starch remained. Less starch remaining meant higher enzyme activity.


The results are summarized below:


Tube A: 10°C → 80% of starch remaining


Tube B: 25°C → 40% of starch remaining


Tube C: 37°C → 15% of starch remaining


Tube D: 60°C → 70% of starch remaining


The student concluded that the enzyme worked best at a temperature near human body temperature and that very low or very high temperatures reduced its activity.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) describe an experiment testing how temperature relates to enzyme activity.


B) argue that enzymes should never be heated.


C) compare starch to other carbohydrates.


D) explain how to build a water bath from household materials.


Which tube showed the highest enzyme activity?


A) Tube A


B) Tube B


C) Tube C


D) Tube D


Compared with Tube B, Tube C had


A) more starch remaining and lower enzyme activity.


B) more starch remaining and higher enzyme activity.


C) less starch remaining and higher enzyme activity.


D) less starch remaining and lower enzyme activity.


Which statement is best supported by the data?


A) The enzyme works equally well at all temperatures tested.


B) The enzyme works best at moderate temperatures and less effectively at very low or high temperatures.


C) The enzyme works only at temperatures below 10°C.


D) The enzyme cannot function at body temperature.


If the student tested a new Tube E at 45°C, which prediction would be most reasonable?


A) The enzyme activity would certainly be higher than in Tube C.


B) The enzyme activity might be lower than at 37°C because very high temperatures can reduce activity.


C) The enzyme activity would be zero.


D) The enzyme activity would be exactly the same as in Tube A.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that extreme temperatures reduce enzyme activity?


A) "The student mixed starch and the enzyme in four separate test tubes…"


B) "After ten minutes, the student measured how much starch remained."


C) "Tube C: 37°C → 15% of starch remaining."


D) "The student concluded that the enzyme worked best at a temperature near human body temperature and that very low or very high temperatures reduced its activity."


If these results were graphed with temperature on the horizontal axis and starch remaining on the vertical axis, the point representing Tube D would be


A) at 10°C and 80%.


B) at 25°C and 40%.


C) at 37°C and 15%.


D) at 60°C and 70%.


In the context of the passage, the phrase "worked best" most nearly means that the enzyme


A) completely disappeared in the test tube.


B) removed the largest amount of starch in the given time.


C) could no longer bind to starch molecules.


D) remained at the same temperature.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages – Public Parks vs Private Gyms


Passage 1


When city officials discuss health, they often focus on gyms and fitness centers. Yet not everyone can afford membership fees or feels comfortable exercising indoors. Public parks—open to anyone at no charge—may be the city's most underrated health resource.


Well-designed parks offer walking paths, open fields, playgrounds, and quiet benches under trees. These spaces encourage physical activity and provide mental relief from crowded streets and constant noise. Studies suggest that people who live near green spaces are more likely to engage in regular exercise and report lower stress levels. Investing in parks is, in effect, investing in public health.


Passage 2


Private gyms can provide equipment and specialized training that most public parks cannot. Treadmills, weight machines, and group fitness classes require space, maintenance, and staff that city parks departments may struggle to fund. In bad weather, climate-controlled gyms remain usable when parks are empty.


However, gym memberships cost money, and even discounted rates can be out of reach for many residents. Gyms that require long-term contracts may exclude people with unstable incomes or changing schedules. While private fitness centers play an important role, relying on them alone risks leaving out those who could most benefit from opportunities to exercise.


Both passages most strongly suggest that


A) only public parks can improve health.


B) only private gyms can improve health.


C) access to exercise opportunities should not depend entirely on private gyms.


D) exercise is unnecessary if people eat healthy food.


The central claim of Passage 1 is that


A) private gyms are unnecessary and should be banned.


B) public parks are an important, often undervalued tool for supporting community health.


C) city officials should stop discussing health altogether.


D) playgrounds are more important than walking paths.


The central claim of Passage 2 is that


A) gyms are affordable for everyone.


B) parks are useless in bad weather.


C) private gyms offer valuable services but may exclude people who cannot pay.


D) cities should close all parks and build gyms instead.


Which sentence from Passage 1 best supports the idea that parks can reduce stress?


A) "Yet not everyone can afford membership fees…"


B) "Public parks—open to anyone at no charge—may be the city's most underrated health resource."


C) "These spaces encourage physical activity and provide mental relief from crowded streets and constant noise."


D) "Investing in parks is, in effect, investing in public health."


Passage 2 indicates that one advantage of private gyms is that they


A) are outdoors.


B) remain accessible during bad weather.


C) are free to all residents.


D) never require contracts.


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) some people cannot afford gym memberships.


B) parks are more expensive than gyms.


C) people do not like exercising in parks.


D) cities should eliminate all public exercise spaces.


In Passage 2, the phrase "relying on them alone" most nearly refers to


A) using treadmills for long periods.


B) depending only on private gyms for public exercise options.


C) allowing people to exercise without supervision.


D) funding parks with city taxes.


Which choice best describes the relationship between the two passages?


A) Passage 1 argues for parks and Passage 2 argues against any exercise.


B) Passage 1 criticizes gyms, and Passage 2 defends them while noting their limitations.


C) Passage 1 and Passage 2 both argue that neither parks nor gyms should exist.


D) Passage 1 and Passage 2 are unrelated to exercise or health.


On which proposal would the authors of both passages most likely agree?


A) Building more parks while also ensuring gyms remain available


B) Closing all parks and replacing them with parking lots


C) Raising gym prices so that only serious athletes attend


D) Prohibiting outdoor exercise in cities


The final sentence of Passage 2 ("While private fitness centers play an important role, relying on them alone risks leaving out those who could most benefit from opportunities to exercise.") mainly serves to


A) praise gyms as perfect solutions.


B) emphasize the need for inclusive exercise options beyond just gyms.


C) argue that people should stop exercising.


D) introduce a discussion of professional sports.
