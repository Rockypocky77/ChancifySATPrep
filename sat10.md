SAT PRACTICE TEST 10


SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)

---

**Question 1**

Maya moved back to her childhood town after ten years away. The houses looked smaller now, as if they had quietly folded in on themselves while she was gone. The bakery still leaned on the corner, its windows fogged with the familiar warmth of rising dough. As she walked down the street, she realized that nothing had truly stayed the same; instead, everything had learned to resemble its old self. Maya felt both like an intruder and a historian, carrying a version of the town that no longer existed except in her memory.

The passage primarily suggests that Maya

A) regrets returning to a town that has completely erased her past
B) finds the town unrecognizable and cold without familiar landmarks
C) experiences the town as familiar yet subtly changed, creating mixed emotions
D) is amazed the town has remained exactly as she remembered it

---

**Question 2**

The new café with its bright metal chairs sat where the dusty bookstore used to be. Children raced past her, shouting the same games with different slang. The bakery still leaned on the corner, but the baker was someone's daughter now, not the grey-haired man who had slipped Maya free cookies. Everything had learned to resemble its old self—close enough to trigger memory, different enough to feel like looking at a photograph that had been subtly altered.


B) "The bakery still leaned on the corner, its windows fogged with the familiar warmth of rising dough."


C) "The new café with its bright metal chairs sat where the dusty bookstore used to be."


D) "Maya felt both like an intruder and a historian, carrying a version of the town that no longer existed except in her memory."


In line "everything had learned to resemble its old self," the phrase "resemble its old self" most nearly means


A) becoming completely different and transformed beyond recognition.


B) pretending to be new and disguising its original appearance.


C) looking almost like it used to.


D) looking exactly the same as before without any modifications.


The description of the bakery ("leaned on the corner… windows fogged with the familiar warmth") primarily serves to


A) introduce a setting that contrasts with Maya's negative emotions and provides relief.


B) show that some aspects of the town still feel comforting and recognizable.


C) criticize the town's lack of modernization and resistance to progress.


D) highlight the bakery as the only place that has not changed and remained constant.


Which inference about Maya is best supported by the passage?


A) She wishes she had never left her hometown.


B) She is unsure how to reconcile her memories with what she sees now.


C) She plans to convince the town to restore old buildings.


D) She is eager to move away again as soon as possible.


The comparison that "the houses looked smaller now" suggests that


A) the town has physically shrunk in size.


B) Maya's perspective has changed as she has grown older.


C) the town is wealthier and more crowded than before.


D) the buildings have been rebuilt with cheaper materials.


The tone of the passage is best described as


A) bitter and resentful.


B) nostalgic and reflective.


C) excited and optimistic.


D) confused and panicked.


Questions 8–15: Social Science Passage


Many cities are experimenting with "open streets" programs, which temporarily close certain roads to cars and reserve them for pedestrians and cyclists. Supporters argue that these events encourage physical activity, support local businesses, and create a sense of community. Critics, however, worry about traffic congestion and reduced access for people who rely on vehicles.


Early research on open streets suggests that the benefits may be greatest in neighborhoods that are usually dominated by car traffic. In such areas, a single afternoon without cars can change residents' perceptions of their streets. They may recognize, perhaps for the first time, that a road can be more than a route from one place to another; it can be a gathering space, a playground, or a temporary stage.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that open streets programs should replace all car traffic.


B) explain what open streets programs are and describe some of their effects.


C) criticize cities for prioritizing cars over pedestrians.


D) show that open streets programs are more harmful than helpful.


Which choice best describes the structure of the passage?


A) A claim is introduced, and several unrelated examples are listed.


B) A controversial idea is described, and then a personal story is shared.


C) A program is presented along with both concerns and possible benefits.


D) A problem is described, and a clear solution is proposed.


Which sentence best supports the idea that open streets can change how residents think about their environment?


A) "Many cities are experimenting with 'open streets' programs…"


B) "Critics, however, worry about traffic congestion and reduced access…"


C) "Early research on open streets suggests that the benefits may be greatest in neighborhoods that are usually dominated by car traffic."


D) "They may recognize, perhaps for the first time, that a road can be more than a route from one place to another…"


As used in the passage, "dominated by car traffic" most nearly means


A) built only for public transportation.


B) completely unsafe for pedestrians.


C) heavily used by vehicles compared with other uses.


D) closed off to all non-residents.


The author's attitude toward open streets programs can best be described as


A) cautiously optimistic.


B) strongly opposed.


C) uninterested.


D) fully certain of their success.


Which of the following is an inference supported by the passage?


A) Open streets programs never cause traffic congestion.


B) Residents in car-dominated neighborhoods cannot walk safely at any time.


C) Some people might begin to support open streets after experiencing one.


D) All businesses benefit equally from open streets programs.


Which choice best states the function of the second paragraph?


A) It introduces a counterargument that disproves the first paragraph.


B) It presents research findings that add depth to the discussion of open streets.


C) It lists unrelated problems with urban planning.


D) It repeats the first paragraph's information in simpler terms.


The phrase "a temporary stage" at the end of the passage suggests that


A) streets are dangerous for performances.


B) streets can become places for public events and performances.


C) only professional actors use open streets programs.


D) open streets events should be permanent.


Questions 16–23: Natural Science Passage with Data


A group of students studied how much light different plants in their classroom received and how tall those plants grew over six weeks. They measured light in "hours of direct light per day" and height in centimeters.


The results are summarized in the following description of a bar chart:


 • Plant A receives 2 hours of direct light per day and has an average height of 10 cm.


 • Plant B receives 4 hours of direct light per day and has an average height of 16 cm.


 • Plant C receives 6 hours of direct light per day and has an average height of 21 cm.


 • Plant D receives 8 hours of direct light per day and has an average height of 23 cm.


The students concluded that increasing light generally increased plant height, but that the effect became smaller at higher light levels.


What is the main purpose of this passage?


A) To argue that plants should never receive more than four hours of light per day.


B) To describe an experiment showing how plant growth changes with different light amounts.


C) To explain why plants cannot grow without fertilizer.


D) To compare plant growth in different types of soil.


Based on the data, which plant experienced the largest increase in height per additional 2 hours of light compared with the previous plant?


A) Plant A


B) Plant B


C) Plant C


D) Plant D


Compared with Plant B, Plant D receives


A) 2 more hours of light and is 7 cm taller.


B) 4 more hours of light and is 7 cm taller.


C) 4 more hours of light and is 13 cm taller.


D) 6 more hours of light and is 13 cm taller.


The data most strongly support which statement?


A) Every additional 2 hours of light always adds exactly 6 cm of height.


B) Plants that receive 8 hours of light are twice as tall as plants that receive 4 hours.


C) The relationship between light and height is increasing but with smaller gains at higher light levels.


D) Light has no effect on plant growth.


Suppose the students add a new Plant E that receives 10 hours of direct light per day. Based on the pattern in the data, which prediction is most reasonable?


A) Plant E will be exactly 30 cm tall.


B) Plant E will be somewhat taller than Plant D but not by much.


C) Plant E will be shorter than Plant A.


D) Plant E will not grow at all.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that light has diminishing returns at higher levels?


A) "A group of students studied how much light different plants in their classroom received…"


B) "The results are summarized in the following description of a bar chart…"


C) "The students concluded that increasing light generally increased plant height, but that the effect became smaller at higher light levels."


D) "They measured light in 'hours of direct light per day' and height in centimeters."


If a line of best fit were drawn through the bar chart described, which statement would best describe its slope?


A) The slope would be negative because height decreases as light increases.


B) The slope would be positive because height generally increases as light increases.


C) The slope would be zero because height stays the same as light increases.


D) The slope would constantly change directions between positive and negative.


In the context of this passage, the word "effect" most nearly refers to


A) the appearance of the plants.


B) the cause of the experiment.


C) the influence of light on plant height.


D) the students' opinion of gardening.


Questions 24–33: Paired Passages (Humanities / Social Science)


Passage 4A


When I visit a museum, I walk quickly at first. I want an overview, a sense of the whole place: the echo of footsteps, the chill of the air near the stone walls, the soft hum of whispered conversations. Only after this first circuit do I return to a single painting and sit in front of it. I watch the colors sharpen as my eyes stop rushing. For me, a museum is not a checklist of masterpieces to "see" but a place to practice paying attention.


Passage 4B


City planners often treat museums as destinations: buildings that attract tourists, generate revenue, and signal cultural prestige. In their reports, museums are described in numbers—visitor counts, ticket prices, and the size of the permanent collection. But this view is incomplete. For many residents, a museum is less a destination than a weekly habit: a quiet space to think, a familiar hallway to wander during a difficult afternoon. Planners who overlook these everyday uses miss an important part of their cities' emotional infrastructure.

C) develop the idea that the author needs an overall impression before focusing.


D) prove that the museum is too small.


In Passage 4B, the phrase "emotional infrastructure" most nearly refers to


A) bridges and roads that lead to museums.


B) the feelings of tourists visiting the city.
