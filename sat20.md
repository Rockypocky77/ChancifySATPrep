SAT PRACTICE TEST 20


SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


A Different Sky


 When my older brother left for flight school, the house seemed to tilt slightly, as if it were adjusting to his absence. His bedroom door, once constantly open, now stayed closed, a flat rectangle of silence at the end of the hallway.


We had always been opposites. He liked heights; I preferred solid ground. He climbed trees, rooftops, anything that put him closer to the clouds. I stayed below, holding jackets, shoes, and occasionally my breath when he dangled his feet over the edge of our garage roof.


The night before he left, we sat on the back porch. The sky was clear, the stars unusually sharp. He traced lines between them with his finger, quietly connecting constellations only he could see.


"You know," he said, "it's not really about flying."


"Then what is it about?" I asked.


"Perspective," he replied. "Seeing everything from a different angle. Remembering that problems look smaller when you're farther away."


At the time, the idea sounded like something he'd copied from a motivational poster. But weeks later, when I walked past his closed door after a bad day at school, I caught myself imagining how our neighborhood would look from the cockpit of a small plane—our driveway just a line, the school a cluster of rectangles, my worries shrinking with every thousand feet.


The passage primarily focuses on the narrator


A) acquiring knowledge about pilot certification requirements and the specific procedures involved in professional flight training programs.


B) recounting interpersonal conflict with their brother regarding relocation decisions and describing tensions that arise within family relationships.


C) contemplating their brother's departure and exploring the conceptual framework of "perspective" as a way of understanding distance, scale, and emotional processing.


D) attempting to convince readers to pursue aviation education and enroll in flight school programs as a career pathway.


Which sentence best supports the answer to Question 1?


A) "His bedroom door, once constantly open, now stayed closed…"


B) "We had always been opposites."


C) "'You know,' he said, 'it's not really about flying.'"


D) "I caught myself imagining how our neighborhood would look from the cockpit of a small plane…"


The narrator's attitude toward the brother's idea about "perspective" changes from


A) bewilderment and lack of comprehension to hostile feelings and exasperation with the concept.


B) doubt and initial disbelief to developing some level of comprehension and recognition of the idea's validity.


C) eager acceptance and positive anticipation to disillusionment and letdown regarding the concept's applicability.


D) apprehension and concern to complete disinterest and lack of emotional investment in the idea.


The description of the stars as "unusually sharp" (paragraph 3) mainly serves to


A) suggest that the weather is turning cold.


B) emphasize the clarity of the moment between the siblings.


C) criticize light pollution in the neighborhood.


D) indicate that the narrator enjoys astronomy.


The image of the house "tilt[ing] slightly" in paragraph 1 is best interpreted as


A) a literal architectural problem.


B) a sign that the narrator is dizzy.


C) a metaphor for how the family feels unbalanced without the brother.


D) evidence that the brother damaged the house before leaving.


At the end of the passage, imagining the view from a plane helps the narrator


A) forget about school entirely.


B) decide never to speak to their brother again.


C) apply the brother's lesson by mentally shrinking their worries.


D) plan to move to a different city.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


The Rise of Remote Work


 In recent years, many companies have experimented with remote work arrangements, allowing employees to perform their jobs from home or other locations outside the office. Supporters argue that remote work increases flexibility and can improve work-life balance. Without daily commutes, employees save time and money, which may reduce stress.


Critics, however, worry about isolation and blurred boundaries. When work emails arrive at all hours, employees may find it difficult to "switch off." Some managers also fear that remote teams will be harder to supervise or that collaboration will suffer when people rarely meet in person.


Research so far suggests a mixed picture. In some industries, remote work has boosted productivity and employee satisfaction. In others, it has highlighted inequalities—for example, workers without quiet spaces or reliable internet may struggle more than their colleagues. As companies adjust policies, the challenge will be finding arrangements that support both efficiency and fairness.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that remote work should replace offices entirely.


B) describe potential benefits and drawbacks of remote work.


C) explain how to set up a home office.


D) criticize employees who prefer working from home.


According to the passage, one advantage of remote work is that it


A) always guarantees higher salaries.


B) eliminates the need for managers.


C) reduces commuting time and costs.


D) prevents all workplace conflicts.


The passage suggests that one concern about remote work is that


A) employees have no access to the internet.


B) managers worry about supervising remote teams.


C) workers are always happier at home.


D) offices will become too crowded.


Which sentence best supports the idea that remote work can create inequality?


A) "Supporters argue that remote work increases flexibility and can improve work-life balance."


B) "Critics, however, worry about isolation and blurred boundaries."


C) "In others, it has highlighted inequalities—for example, workers without quiet spaces or reliable internet may struggle more than their colleagues."


D) "As companies adjust policies, the challenge will be finding arrangements that support both efficiency and fairness."


The author's attitude toward remote work is best described as


A) strongly negative.


B) uncritically positive.


C) balanced, recognizing both benefits and challenges.


D) indifferent and uninterested.


The final sentence ("the challenge will be finding arrangements that support both efficiency and fairness") suggests that companies should


A) avoid remote work completely.


B) design flexible policies that consider both productivity and equity.


C) base decisions only on internet speed.


D) allow employees to work wherever they want without rules.


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


Soil pH and Enzyme Activity


 A student investigated how soil pH affected the activity of an enzyme involved in decomposing plant material. The student prepared four soil samples that were identical except for pH. Each sample contained the same amount of enzyme and organic matter. After one week, the student measured how much organic matter remained. Less organic matter remaining indicated higher enzyme activity.


The results are summarized below:


 • Sample A: pH 4.0 → 80% of organic matter remaining


 • Sample B: pH 5.5 → 45% of organic matter remaining


 • Sample C: pH 7.0 → 20% of organic matter remaining


 • Sample D: pH 8.5 → 35% of organic matter remaining


Based on the data, the student concluded that this enzyme worked best near neutral pH and was less active in more acidic or more alkaline soils.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) explain how soil pH affects an enzyme's activity in decomposition.


B) argue that all soils should be made acidic.


C) compare different types of plant roots.


D) describe how to build a pH meter.


Which sample showed the highest enzyme activity?


A) Sample A


B) Sample B


C) Sample C


D) Sample D


Compared with Sample B, Sample C had


A) more organic matter remaining and lower enzyme activity.


B) more organic matter remaining and higher enzyme activity.


C) less organic matter remaining and higher enzyme activity.


D) less organic matter remaining and lower enzyme activity.


Which statement is best supported by the data?


A) The enzyme works equally well at all pH levels.


B) The enzyme works best at or near neutral pH and less effectively at more acidic or alkaline pH values.


C) The enzyme works only in acidic soils.


D) The enzyme cannot function at pH 7.0.


If the student tested a new Sample E with pH 7.5, which prediction would be most consistent with the pattern?


A) Enzyme activity might be slightly lower than in Sample C but still relatively high.


B) Enzyme activity would be zero.


C) Enzyme activity would be far higher than in any other sample.


D) Enzyme activity would match Sample A exactly.


Which sentence from the passage most directly supports the conclusion that extreme pH levels reduce enzyme activity?


A) "Each sample contained the same amount of enzyme and organic matter."


B) "Sample A: pH 4.0 → 80% of organic matter remaining."


C) "Sample C: pH 7.0 → 20% of organic matter remaining."


D) "Based on the data, the student concluded that this enzyme worked best near neutral pH and was less active in more acidic or more alkaline soils."


If these results were graphed with pH on the horizontal axis and organic matter remaining on the vertical axis, the point representing Sample D would be


A) (4.0, 80)


B) (5.5, 45)


C) (7.0, 20)


D) (8.5, 35)


In this experiment, "less organic matter remaining" is used as an indicator of


A) lower enzyme activity.


B) higher enzyme activity.


C) total soil mass.


D) pH changes over time.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages – Local Newspapers vs Online News


Passage 1


 Local newspapers once anchored community life. They reported on school board meetings, local sports, and neighborhood issues that rarely appeared in national media. When a small town loses its newspaper, residents may struggle to find reliable information about local decisions that affect their daily lives. Some researchers have linked the decline of local news to lower voter turnout and reduced trust in institutions.


Passage 2


 Online news sources have transformed how people access information. With a few taps on a phone, readers can follow national and international stories from multiple perspectives. Digital platforms also allow independent journalists and community groups to publish updates without owning a printing press. However, online news can be fragmented and overwhelming, and algorithms may prioritize attention-grabbing headlines over careful local reporting.
