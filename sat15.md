SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


The Door


Every Tuesday afternoon, I walked past the door. It was painted a faded blue, the color of an old bruise, and it had a tarnished brass knob that never seemed to turn. The building itself was unremarkable—gray brick, three stories, nestled between a bookstore and a bakery that smelled of cinnamon and yeast.


I walked past it because the library was two blocks further, and I liked to take the long way home. But I also walked past it because I was curious. What was inside? Why did no one ever come out? Once, I saw a light flicker in a second-floor window, but when I looked again, it was gone.


My mother said it was probably an office building, closed after hours. My friend Lauren said it was haunted. I decided it was something else entirely: a place where secrets lived, where ordinary rules didn't apply.


On the Tuesday after my sixteenth birthday, I realized I had been walking past that door for almost a year. I stopped in front of it. The street was quiet except for a distant siren and the rustle of leaves in the wind. I reached out and touched the knob. It was cold, even though the afternoon sun was warm against my back.


Without thinking, I pushed. The door swung open silently, revealing a hallway lined with bookshelves. Not an office. Not haunted. A library, smaller and dustier than the one downtown, but a library all the same.


The passage primarily focuses on


A) the narrator's fear of old buildings and architectural anxiety.


B) the narrator's curiosity about a mysterious door and what lies behind it.


C) a conflict between the narrator and their mother and family tensions.


D) the history of an abandoned bookstore and its previous ownership.


The description of the door's color as "the color of an old bruise" (paragraph 1) primarily serves to


A) indicate that the door was recently damaged and requires repair.


B) create a visual image that suggests age and wear.


C) prove that the building was dangerous and posed safety risks.


D) show that the narrator dislikes the color blue and has color preferences.


The narrator's decision to touch the door knob (paragraph 5) is best described as


A) impulsive and driven by longstanding curiosity.


B) planned after extensive research about the building and historical investigation.


C) motivated by a fear of the unknown and anxiety about potential dangers.


D) the result of pressure from friends.


Which choice best describes the narrator's attitude toward the door over time?


A) Initially fearful, then completely uninterested.


B) Initially curious, then increasingly determined to solve the mystery.


C) Initially dismissive, then suddenly terrified.


D) Initially angry, then accepting.


The phrase "where ordinary rules didn't apply" (paragraph 3) most nearly means that the narrator imagined a place where


A) library books were free.


B) normal expectations or limitations might not exist.


C) teenagers were not allowed.


D) the door was always locked.


The overall tone of the passage shifts from


A) disappointed to excited.


B) mysterious and curious to resolved and satisfied.


C) angry to forgiving.


D) bored to terrified.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


The concept of "digital detox"—taking breaks from smartphones and social media—has gained popularity as people report feeling overwhelmed by constant connectivity. Some advocates suggest that even short daily breaks can reduce stress and improve focus. However, critics argue that the term "detox" implies that technology itself is inherently harmful, rather than recognizing that how people use technology matters more than whether they use it.


Recent research supports a nuanced view. A study of college students found that those who took brief, intentional breaks from their phones during study sessions reported higher levels of concentration and satisfaction. However, completely avoiding technology for extended periods often wasn't practical or necessary. Students who balanced focused work time with limited, scheduled checking of messages tended to perform better than those who tried to eliminate technology entirely.


The findings suggest that mindful technology use—being intentional about when and why you pick up a device—may be more effective than strict abstinence. Creating specific "tech-free" zones or times can help people disconnect when they need to focus, without requiring a complete overhaul of daily routines.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that all technology should be banned.


B) present research suggesting that mindful, intentional breaks from technology may be more effective than complete avoidance.


C) prove that digital detox programs are always harmful.


D) describe the history of smartphone development.


According to the passage, one finding from research on college students is that


A) complete avoidance of technology always leads to better academic performance.


B) brief, intentional breaks from phones during study can improve concentration.


C) students should never check messages while studying.


D) technology use has no impact on academic performance.


The passage suggests that critics of "digital detox" are concerned that the term


A) is too complicated for most people to understand.


B) implies technology is inherently harmful rather than focusing on how it's used.


C) doesn't sound scientific enough.


D) is difficult to translate into other languages.


Which choice best describes how the passage addresses the idea of taking breaks from technology?


A) It dismisses the idea as completely ineffective.


B) It presents research suggesting that mindful, intentional breaks can be helpful, while complete avoidance may be impractical.


C) It argues that only extended breaks lasting months are worthwhile.


D) It claims that breaks are only beneficial for college students.


The author's attitude toward "digital detox" is best described as


A) completely supportive and uncritical.


B) entirely dismissive and negative.


C) balanced, acknowledging both support and criticism while presenting evidence for a nuanced approach.


D) uninterested in the topic.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that complete elimination of technology may not be necessary or practical?


A) "The concept of 'digital detox'—taking breaks from smartphones and social media—has gained popularity…"


B) "Some advocates suggest that even short daily breaks can reduce stress and improve focus."


C) "However, completely avoiding technology for extended periods often wasn't practical or necessary."


D) "The findings suggest that mindful technology use—being intentional about when and why you pick up a device—may be more effective than strict abstinence."


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


A biology class studied how different amounts of fertilizer affect tomato plant growth. Students planted seeds in identical pots and applied fertilizer at different rates: 0 grams, 5 grams, 10 grams, and 15 grams per pot. After eight weeks, they measured the height of each plant.


The results are shown below:


 • Group 1: 0 grams fertilizer → average height: 20 centimeters


 • Group 2: 5 grams fertilizer → average height: 35 centimeters


 • Group 3: 10 grams fertilizer → average height: 48 centimeters


 • Group 4: 15 grams fertilizer → average height: 50 centimeters


The class concluded that fertilizer generally increased plant growth, but adding more fertilizer beyond 10 grams per pot produced only small additional growth.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that fertilizer is harmful to plants.


B) describe an experiment examining how fertilizer amounts relate to plant height.


C) compare fertilizer used in different countries.


D) show that fertilizer has no effect on plant growth.


Between which two groups is the largest increase in average height observed?


A) Group 1 and Group 2


B) Group 2 and Group 3


C) Group 1 and Group 3

Compared with Group 2, Group 3's average height is


A) 13 centimeters taller.


B) 13 centimeters shorter.


C) 15 centimeters taller.


D) 15 centimeters shorter.


Which statement is best supported by the data?


A) Fertilizer always increases plant height by exactly 15 centimeters per 5 grams.


B) Plant height increases steadily as fertilizer amount increases, with diminishing returns at higher doses.


C) Fertilizer has no relationship with plant height.


D) Plants grow tallest without any fertilizer.


If the class added a Group 5 that received 20 grams of fertilizer, which prediction is most reasonable based on the pattern in the data?


A) The average height would be exactly 100 centimeters.


B) The average height would likely be slightly taller than 50 centimeters, but not dramatically taller.


C) The average height would return to 20 centimeters.


D) The average height would be impossible to measure.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that additional fertilizer becomes less effective at higher amounts?


A) "Students planted seeds in identical pots and applied fertilizer at different rates…"


B) "After eight weeks, they measured the height of each plant."


C) "The class concluded that fertilizer generally increased plant growth, but adding more fertilizer beyond 10 grams per pot produced only small additional growth."


D) "The results are shown below:"


If the results were graphed with fertilizer amount on the horizontal axis and plant height on the vertical axis, the line of best fit would most likely have


A) a positive slope that becomes steeper at higher amounts.


B) a positive slope that becomes less steep at higher amounts.


C) a negative slope.


D) a slope of zero.


In the context of the passage, the phrase "diminishing returns" most nearly means that


A) fertilizer stops working entirely.


B) each additional amount of fertilizer produces a smaller increase in height.


C) fertilizer becomes more expensive.


D) plants start to shrink.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages – Public Libraries


Passage 1


When I moved to a new city for college, I didn't know anyone. The campus was huge, and I felt lost among thousands of students. Then I found the public library downtown. It smelled like old paper and dust, and the chairs were worn, but it became my refuge.


I spent hours there, not just studying but also browsing. I discovered books I never would have found online—local history collections, poetry anthologies, rare photography books. The librarians helped me navigate the catalog when I was researching a paper, and they recommended novels that became favorites.


Now, five years later, I still visit that library whenever I'm in town. It's not just about the books. It's about the quiet, the community, the sense that knowledge lives in those shelves and is waiting for anyone who wants it.


Passage 2


Public libraries face significant challenges in the digital age. Many people now access information online rather than visiting physical buildings. As a result, some libraries have reported declining circulation of physical books. However, libraries have also adapted by expanding digital services, offering e-books, online databases, and computer access for patrons who lack reliable internet at home.


Additionally, libraries serve functions beyond book lending. They provide meeting spaces for community groups, host educational programs, and offer resources for job seekers. Some libraries have even added makerspaces with 3D printers and technology workshops.


The question is not whether libraries are still relevant, but how they can continue evolving to meet changing community needs while preserving their core mission of providing free access to information and knowledge.


Both passages most strongly suggest that


A) libraries are no longer useful in modern society.


B) libraries offer value beyond simply lending books.


C) libraries should only focus on digital services.


D) physical books are completely outdated.


The central claim of Passage 2 is that


A) libraries are obsolete and should be closed.


B) libraries can remain relevant by adapting to new technologies and community needs while maintaining their core mission.


C) all libraries should become makerspaces.


D) libraries should stop lending physical books entirely.


Compared with the tone of Passage 2, the tone of Passage 1 is more


A) personal and nostalgic.


B) formal and analytical.


C) critical and dismissive.


D) humorous and satirical.


Which sentence from Passage 1 best illustrates the narrator's emotional connection to the library?

B) "Now, five years later, I still visit that library whenever I'm in town."


C) "The librarians helped me navigate the catalog when I was researching a paper…"


D) "It's not just about the books."


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) libraries should charge admission fees.


B) libraries provide valuable resources and services to communities.


C) physical books are more important than digital resources.


D) libraries only matter for college students.


In Passage 1, the phrase "my refuge" primarily serves to


A) indicate that the narrator was hiding from the law.


B) show that the library was a place of comfort and safety during a difficult time.


C) prove that the library was expensive.


D) suggest that the narrator was always studying.


In Passage 2, the mention of "makerspaces" primarily serves to


A) list every service that libraries offer.


B) give an example of how libraries are adapting to include new technology and community needs.


C) argue that libraries should only focus on technology.


D) show that libraries are becoming too expensive.


Which choice best describes the relationship between the two passages?


A) Passage 1 provides a personal example that supports the broader argument in Passage 2 about libraries' continued relevance and adaptation.


B) Passage 1 contradicts all the claims made in Passage 2.


C) Passage 2 retells the story from Passage 1 from a librarian's perspective.


D) The passages discuss completely unrelated topics.


On which proposal would the authors most likely disagree?


A) Libraries should provide free access to information


B) Libraries serve important community functions beyond book lending


C) Libraries should completely eliminate all physical books and become only digital


D) Libraries need to adapt to changing technology


The final sentence of Passage 2 ("The question is not whether libraries are still relevant, but how they can continue evolving to meet changing community needs while preserving their core mission of providing free access to information and knowledge.") mainly serves to


A) argue that libraries are completely irrelevant.


B) emphasize that libraries can remain valuable by evolving while maintaining core values.


C) introduce an unrelated topic about internet access.


D) suggest that libraries should charge fees.
