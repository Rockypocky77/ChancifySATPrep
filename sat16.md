SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


The Mural


The first time I saw the gym wall, it was just a blank stretch of beige cinder blocks, the kind of wall that made you feel like whispering. Our principal said it looked "clean." I thought it looked like a pause that never ended.


When our art teacher announced we'd be designing a mural, half the class cheered and the other half groaned. I didn't do either. I just opened my sketchbook. I'd been drawing ideas on my own for months—stars, running shoes, hands reaching out to pass a relay baton—but I had never pictured them ten feet tall.


"We want something that represents our school," Mr. Larson said, tapping the whiteboard. "Not just the mascot. Who we are. What we're trying to be."


My best friend Jana nudged me. "Show him your sketch," she whispered.


The thought of it made my face heat up. My drawings were safe on paper, where no one could trip over them during basketball practice. On the wall, everyone would see them as they walked into assemblies, games, ceremonies. If the mural looked childish or clumsy, there'd be no way to hide it.


After class, I stayed behind anyway. My feet moved toward Mr. Larson before my brain could talk me out of it. I held out my sketchbook, open to a page where three runners formed a circle—each one passing a baton forward, the last one handing it back to the first. Above them, I'd written a line we'd read in English class: "We are more than what we were alone."


He studied it for a long moment. "This," he said finally, "isn't just a drawing. It's an idea. Can you imagine this wrapping across the whole wall?"


I could. It terrified me. It thrilled me. It felt like painting a promise where everyone could see it.


The passage primarily focuses on


A) an educator providing critical assessment of a student's artistic work and delivering feedback that highlights deficiencies or areas needing improvement.


B) a student's internal deliberation about whether to reveal and submit a personal creative design concept for consideration as a school-wide mural project.


C) an administrator's process of selecting an official school symbol and mascot to represent the institution's identity and values.


D) a discussion or disagreement about whether to renovate and repaint the school gymnasium, involving considerations of aesthetics and facility improvements.


Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?


A) "Our principal said it looked 'clean.' I thought it looked like a pause that never ended."


B) "'We want something that represents our school,' Mr. Larson said…"


C) "My best friend Jana nudged me. 'Show him your sketch,' she whispered."


D) "After class, I stayed behind anyway… I held out my sketchbook…"


The narrator's reaction to the idea of the sketch becoming a mural is best described as


A) characterized by apathy and lack of engagement, showing no emotional investment in the project's outcome.


B) marked by bitterness and hostility directed toward the instructor's requirements and anticipated standards for the assignment.


C) experiencing simultaneous apprehension and enthusiasm about exposing their personal artistic work to public view and evaluation.


D) possessing absolute certainty that the mural will receive universal approval and positive reception from all viewers.


The phrase "my drawings were safe on paper" (paragraph 5) primarily suggests that the narrator


A) dislikes drawing but does it anyway.


B) fears having their work judged when it is visible to others.


C) thinks paper is stronger than paint.


D) has never shown the sketchbook to anyone.


What is the main function of the description of the gym wall in the first paragraph?


A) To criticize the principal's decorating choices


B) To introduce the setting and emphasize how empty the wall feels before the mural


C) To explain the history of the school's sports program


D) To show that the narrator dislikes school assemblies


The final sentence ("It felt like painting a promise where everyone could see it.") mainly conveys the narrator's sense that


A) the mural will be quickly erased.


B) the project is permanent and meaningful.


C) art class is less important than sports.


D) the promise is only for the teacher, not the students.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


Remote Work and the Future of Offices


Before the global pandemic, remote work was often treated as a perk reserved for a small group of employees. Today, it has become a central topic in debates about the future of work. Some companies have adopted "remote-first" policies, allowing employees to work from home nearly all the time. Others require workers to return to physical offices several days a week.


Supporters of remote work argue that it can increase productivity and reduce commuting time. Employees may be able to live in more affordable areas instead of clustering near expensive city centers. Some companies report that flexible arrangements help them attract talent from around the world, not just from one region.


Critics, however, are concerned about isolation and communication problems. New employees may find it harder to build relationships or ask quick questions when they are not physically near coworkers. Managers sometimes worry that creative brainstorming suffers when people rarely share the same room.


As a result, many organizations are experimenting with "hybrid" models, in which employees split their time between home and office. These models attempt to balance flexibility with opportunities for in-person collaboration, but they also raise new questions about fairness—such as whether employees who come to the office more often will receive more recognition.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that all offices should close permanently.


B) describe different approaches to remote work and the debates surrounding them.


C) explain how to request permission to work from home.


D) discourage companies from using any hybrid arrangements.


According to the passage, one potential benefit of remote work is that it


A) forces employees to move closer to city centers.


B) allows companies to hire workers from a wider geographic area.


C) eliminates all communication problems between coworkers.


D) guarantees equal recognition for all employees.


The passage suggests that one concern about remote work is that it


A) makes commuting times longer.


B) increases office rent costs.


C) can make it harder for new employees to build relationships.


D) prevents companies from attracting talent.


Which choice best describes the structure of the passage?


A) It introduces a trend, explains benefits, notes criticisms, and describes compromise models.


B) It tells a single worker's story and then gives advice.


C) It presents only the negative consequences of remote work.


D) It explains how remote work technology is built.


The author's attitude toward remote work is best described as


A) strongly opposed.


B) enthusiastic but unrealistic.


C) balanced, acknowledging both advantages and challenges.


D) uninterested in workplace policies.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that hybrid models can present new challenges?


A) "Supporters of remote work argue that it can increase productivity…"


B) "Critics, however, are concerned about isolation and communication problems."


C) "As a result, many organizations are experimenting with 'hybrid' models…"


D) "…they also raise new questions about fairness—such as whether employees who come to the office more often will receive more recognition."


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


Fertilizer and Plant Height


A group of students tested how different amounts of fertilizer affected the growth of tomato plants. They planted identical seedlings in similar pots and gave all plants the same amount of water and light. The only difference was the amount of fertilizer added each week.


After eight weeks, they measured the average height of the plants in each group:


Group A: 0 grams of fertilizer per week → 24 cm average height


Group B: 5 grams per week → 32 cm average height


Group C: 10 grams per week → 37 cm average height


Group D: 20 grams per week → 35 cm average height


The students concluded that moderate amounts of fertilizer improved plant growth, but very high amounts did not provide additional benefits and might even reduce growth.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) describe an experiment investigating how fertilizer amounts relate to plant growth.


B) prove that fertilizer is always harmful to plants.


C) compare tomato plants to other kinds of crops.


D) explain how to build a greenhouse from recycled materials.


Between which two groups is the largest increase in average height observed?


A) Group A and Group B


B) Group B and Group C


C) Group C and Group D


D) Group A and Group C


Compared with Group B, Group C's average height is


A) 5 cm shorter.


B) 5 cm taller.


C) 3 cm shorter.


D) 3 cm taller.


Which statement is best supported by the data?


A) Adding more fertilizer always leads to taller plants.


B) Plants with no fertilizer grow taller than all others.


C) Moderate fertilizer use is associated with increased height, but very high levels may reduce growth.


D) Fertilizer has no observable effect on plant height.


If the students added a Group E that received 30 grams of fertilizer per week, which prediction is most reasonable based on the pattern?


A) The plants would definitely grow to 50 cm.


B) The plants would be about the same height as Group A.


C) The plants might be similar in height to Group D or possibly shorter.


D) The plants would be exactly 37 cm tall.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that too much fertilizer can be harmful?


A) "They planted identical seedlings in similar pots…"


B) "The only difference was the amount of fertilizer added each week."


C) "Group D: 20 grams per week → 35 cm average height"


D) "The students concluded that moderate amounts of fertilizer improved plant growth, but very high amounts did not provide additional benefits and might even reduce growth."


If these results were graphed with fertilizer amount on the horizontal axis and plant height on the vertical axis, the overall shape of the graph would most likely


A) rise from Group A to Group C and then dip slightly at Group D.


B) remain perfectly flat at all points.


C) start high at Group A and steadily decrease.


D) alternate high and low randomly.


In the context of the passage, the phrase "might even reduce growth" most nearly means that


A) the plants disappeared entirely.


B) the plants stopped needing water.


C) at high fertilizer levels, plants could become shorter than at moderate levels.


D) the plants grew at the same rate but changed color.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages – Libraries in the Digital Age


Passage 1


When our town library announced it was adding more digital services, I pictured empty shelves and quiet screens. I worried that the building I'd grown up visiting—a place that smelled like paper and dust and possibility—would turn into another silent room where people wore headphones and never looked up.


That didn't happen. Instead, the librarians added e-book borrowing and online databases without removing the shelves I knew. On a typical afternoon, someone might be browsing the fantasy section while another person studies at a table and a third attends a virtual workshop on their laptop. The library feels less like a museum of old books and more like a busy crossroads where information travels in different forms.


Passage 2


Public libraries have always adapted to new technologies. In the early twentieth century, many libraries began lending records and films along with books. Later, they added computers and internet access. Today, offering e-books, audiobooks, and online research tools is simply another step in that evolution.


Some critics claim that digital services might make physical visits unnecessary. However, surveys suggest that many patrons use both printed and digital resources. Libraries now serve as community centers: they host language classes, job-search workshops, and after-school programs, often in the same spaces where novels and biographies line the shelves.


Both passages most strongly suggest that


A) libraries are becoming obsolete because of the internet.


B) libraries can combine print and digital resources to remain active community spaces.


C) physical books should be removed to make room for computers.


D) only digital resources are valuable for modern readers.


The central claim of Passage 2 is that


A) libraries should focus exclusively on digital services.


B) the history of libraries shows that adapting to new technology is part of their ongoing role.


C) physical books are more important than any other resource.


D) libraries should close if people do not read as many printed books.


Compared with Passage 2, Passage 1 is more


A) personal and emotional in describing the library experience.


B) focused on national library statistics.


C) critical of all digital resources.


D) formal and academic in tone.


Which sentence from Passage 1 best shows the narrator's initial concern about digital changes?


A) "When our town library announced it was adding more digital services, I pictured empty shelves and quiet screens."


B) "I worried that the building I'd grown up visiting…would turn into another silent room…"


C) "That didn't happen."


D) "The library feels less like a museum of old books…"


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) digital services have completely replaced physical books.


B) many library visitors still value printed materials.


C) physical books are no longer needed.


D) people rarely attend programs or workshops at libraries.


In Passage 2, the phrase "another step in that evolution" most nearly refers to


A) a decline in library use.


B) a sudden and unprecedented change that libraries cannot handle.


C) the ongoing process of libraries adopting new formats and technologies.


D) a plan to remove all physical materials from libraries.


Which sentence from Passage 2 most directly supports the idea that libraries serve broader community functions beyond lending books?


A) "Public libraries have always adapted to new technologies."


B) "Today, offering e-books, audiobooks, and online research tools is simply another step in that evolution."


C) "Some critics claim that digital services might make physical visits unnecessary."


D) "Libraries now serve as community centers: they host language classes, job-search workshops, and after-school programs…"


What is the relationship between the two passages?


A) Passage 1 provides a personal example that supports the broader argument in Passage 2 about libraries' continued relevance and adaptation.


B) Passage 1 disagrees with Passage 2 about the value of digital resources.


C) Passage 2 retells the story from Passage 1 from the librarian's point of view.


D) The passages describe completely unrelated topics.


On which proposal would the authors of both passages most likely disagree?


A) Maintaining a mix of print and digital materials


B) Offering community programs inside libraries


C) Closing library buildings and moving to an online-only model


D) Providing internet access and online tools


The final sentence of Passage 1 ("The library feels less like a museum of old books and more like a busy crossroads where information travels in different forms.") mainly serves to


A) criticize the library for being too loud.


B) illustrate the narrator's new appreciation for a library that blends old and new resources.


C) argue that museums of old books are unnecessary.


D) introduce a separate discussion about transportation.


Questions 31–37: Writing – Expression of Ideas


(1) At our school, recycling bins used to be an afterthought: a few blue containers in the corner of the cafeteria, usually overflowing with a mix of bottles, napkins, and half-eaten sandwiches.

(3) After noticing how much trash the school produced every day, they proposed a "Green Week" campaign to raise awareness and improve recycling habits. (4) Their plan included daily announcements, classroom presentations, and posters explaining what could and could not go into each bin. (5) The students would track how much waste the school generated during the week and compare it to an average week. (6) Although organizing the campaign will require cooperation from teachers, custodians, and administrators, the environmental club hopes Green Week will lead to long-term changes rather than a one-time event.
