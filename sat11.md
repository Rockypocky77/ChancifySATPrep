SAT PRACTICE TEST 11


SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


The night before the piano competition, Lena practiced the same piece for the twentieth time. Her fingers traced the keys automatically, but her mind lagged behind, stumbling over what-ifs.


When she was eight, playing for relatives in a crowded living room, wrong notes had made everyone laugh. Now, at seventeen, they felt heavy, like evidence. Her teacher claimed the judges wanted "expression, not perfection," but the red circles on her sheet music suggested otherwise.


Lena stopped mid-measure and let the chord fade. She realized she could no longer tell whether she was playing the piece because she loved it or because she was afraid not to. Tomorrow, under bright lights and a silent audience, she would find out.


The passage primarily explores the narrator's experience of


A) the history of piano competitions and their evolution over time.


B) the pressure a student feels when performance becomes a measure of worth.


C) the difference between classical and modern music and stylistic variations.


D) the technical difficulty of advanced piano pieces and performance challenges.


Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?


A) "The night before the piano competition, Lena practiced the same piece for the twentieth time."


B) "When she was eight, playing for relatives in a crowded living room, wrong notes had made everyone laugh."


C) "Her teacher claimed the judges wanted 'expression, not perfection…'"


D) "Now, at seventeen, they felt heavy, like evidence."


In the passage, the phrase "her mind lagged behind, stumbling over what-ifs" most nearly suggests that Lena


A) is bored by the piece she is playing and lacks interest.


B) has forgotten how to play the piano and lost her skills.


C) is distracted by anxious thoughts about the competition.


D) is trying to memorize new music while performing and learning simultaneously.


The description of Lena's childhood performances ("wrong notes had made everyone laugh") primarily serves to


A) show that her relatives did not take her talent seriously.


B) contrast the relaxed atmosphere of the past with the high stakes she feels now.


C) criticize her family for not training her more strictly.


D) suggest that she preferred performing at home to performing in public.


Which inference about Lena is best supported by the passage?


A) She plans to quit piano after the competition.


B) She is unsure whether her motivation comes from passion or pressure.


C) She believes the judges will be unfair to her.


D) She secretly wishes she had chosen a different instrument.

A) humorous and lighthearted.


B) angry and confrontational.


C) determined and triumphant.


D) tense and introspective.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


In recent years, remote work has shifted from a rare perk to a common arrangement. Surveys show that many employees value the flexibility to choose when and where they work. Some report better focus at home, while others appreciate avoiding long commutes.


However, not all jobs are equally suited to remote work. Positions that depend on physical presence—such as nursing, manufacturing, and food service—cannot simply move online. Even for office jobs, managers worry about maintaining team cohesion and mentoring early-career employees who may feel disconnected through screens.


Rather than treating remote work as a universal solution or a temporary fad, some organizations are experimenting with "hybrid" models. In these arrangements, employees spend part of the week in the office and part working elsewhere. Early data suggest that hybrid schedules can preserve in-person collaboration while still offering flexibility.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) argue that remote work should replace in-person work entirely.


B) describe the rise of remote work and how hybrid models attempt to balance its benefits and challenges.


C) explain how remote work harms all types of jobs.


D) promote working exclusively from the office.


According to the passage, which factor limits the spread of remote work?


A) Employees dislike using screens for communication.


B) Remote work always lowers productivity.


C) Some jobs require workers to be physically present.


D) Hybrid schedules are too expensive to implement.


The author distinguishes between fully remote work and hybrid models primarily to


A) show that hybrid models are less popular.


B) argue that fully remote work is impossible.


C) suggest that workers prefer hybrid schedules only when forced.


D) illustrate that some organizations are seeking a middle ground.


Which inference is best supported by the passage?


A) No single approach to work arrangements meets the needs of all jobs and employees.


B) Remote work will soon disappear as offices reopen.


C) Hybrid work eliminates all concerns about isolation.


D) Employees generally prefer commuting to the office every day.


The author's attitude toward remote and hybrid work can best be described as


A) strongly enthusiastic and uncritical.


B) dismissive and skeptical.


C) balanced, acknowledging both benefits and challenges.


D) indifferent and uninterested.


Which choice best describes the structure of the passage?


A) A personal story is told to support a scientific claim.


B) A trend is introduced, its limitations are discussed, and a compromise approach is presented.


C) A problem is described and then definitively solved.


D) Two unrelated workplace topics are briefly mentioned.


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


A researcher investigated how temperature affects the rate of a simple chemical reaction. She ran the reaction at four different temperatures and measured the average reaction time (in seconds) for a visible color change to occur.


The results are described as follows:


 • At 10°C, the reaction took 40 seconds on average.


 • At 20°C, the reaction took 24 seconds on average.


 • At 30°C, the reaction took 15 seconds on average.


 • At 40°C, the reaction took 12 seconds on average.


Based on these data, the researcher concluded that increasing temperature generally decreases reaction time, though the size of the change in reaction time is not the same at every temperature increase.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) prove that all reactions stop above 40°C.


B) describe an experiment that shows how temperature influences reaction speed.


C) compare reactions in liquids and gases.


D) argue that only high temperatures lead to chemical changes.


Between which pair of temperatures does the reaction time decrease by the greatest number of seconds?


A) 10°C and 20°C


B) 20°C and 30°C


C) 10°C and 30°C


D) 30°C and 40°C


Compared with the reaction at 20°C, the reaction at 30°C


A) takes longer to complete.


B) finishes more quickly.


C) shows no difference in time.


D) cannot be measured.


The data most strongly support which statement?


A) Reaction time increases steadily as temperature increases.


B) Temperature has no clear relationship with reaction time.


C) Higher temperatures generally correspond to faster (shorter) reactions.


D) The reaction time is always cut in half when the temperature increases by 10°C.


Suppose the researcher tested the reaction at 50°C. Which prediction is most reasonable based on the pattern in the data?


A) The reaction would take exactly 4 seconds.


B) The reaction time would likely be somewhat shorter than 12 seconds but not drop to zero.


C) The reaction time would return to 40 seconds.


D) The reaction would no longer occur.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that the effect of temperature change is not identical at each step?


A) "A researcher investigated how temperature affects the rate of a simple chemical reaction."


B) "She ran the reaction at four different temperatures…"


C) "Based on these data, the researcher concluded that increasing temperature generally decreases reaction time, though the size of the change in reaction time is not the same at every temperature increase."


D) "The results are described as follows…"


If the data were graphed with temperature on the horizontal axis and reaction time on the vertical axis, the line of best fit would most likely have


A) a positive slope, because higher temperatures mean longer times.


B) a negative slope, because higher temperatures mean shorter times.


C) a slope of zero, because time does not change with temperature.


D) alternating positive and negative segments.


In the context of this passage, the word "effect" in "effect of temperature" most nearly refers to


A) the appearance of the thermometer.


B) the cause of the reaction.


C) the influence temperature has on reaction time.


D) the researcher's opinion of the results.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages (Humanities / Education)


Passage 1


When I take notes by hand, my pages look messy—arrows connecting ideas, comments squeezed into margins, entire paragraphs crossed out and rewritten. Typing on a laptop, by contrast, produces neat rows of text that could almost be mistaken for a finished essay.


Yet my messy notebook is where understanding happens. Writing slowly forces me to choose what matters instead of trying to capture every word the speaker says. Later, when I flip through those pages, the odd spacing and quick sketches remind me how ideas fit together. I am not just recording information; I am building a map of my thinking in real time.


Passage 2


College instructors increasingly see laptops in their classrooms, and the change is not purely positive. Some students use devices to follow along with slides, but others drift into email or social media. Studies comparing handwritten and typed notes suggest that students who type are more likely to copy lectures verbatim, while students who write by hand tend to summarize and reorganize ideas.


This does not mean laptops should be banned. Instead, educators might teach students how and when to use different note-taking tools. For complex discussions, handwritten notes may help students process ideas more deeply. For courses that require large amounts of factual detail, carefully structured digital notes can be useful. The goal is not to declare one method superior but to encourage intentional choices.


Both passages most strongly suggest that


A) typing notes is always a distraction.


B) handwritten notes are neater than typed notes.


C) the way students take notes affects how they process information.


D) laptops should be prohibited in all classrooms.


The central claim of Passage 2 is that


A) laptops should replace notebooks in college classrooms.


B) both handwritten and digital note-taking have roles when used thoughtfully.


C) instructors should punish students who use social media during class.


D) note-taking methods have no effect on learning.


Compared with the tone of Passage 2, the tone of Passage 1 is more


A) analytical and detached.


B) nostalgic and personal.


C) pessimistic and hostile.


D) technical and formal.


Which choice provides the best evidence in Passage 2 that handwritten notes may support deeper thinking?


A) "College instructors increasingly see laptops in their classrooms…"


B) "Some students use devices to follow along with slides…"


C) "Studies comparing handwritten and typed notes suggest that students who type are more likely to copy lectures verbatim, while students who write by hand tend to summarize and reorganize ideas."


D) "This does not mean laptops should be banned."


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) students should never use laptops during lectures.


B) note-taking is more than simply writing down everything a speaker says.


C) typing notes is better for learning than handwriting.


D) instructors should choose one note-taking method for all courses.


In Passage 1, the author's description of "arrows connecting ideas" and "comments squeezed into margins" primarily serves to


A) criticize the author's handwriting.


B) show that the author is not paying attention during lectures.


C) illustrate how handwritten notes reflect a process of actively organizing ideas.


D) suggest that the author is uninterested in the material.


In Passage 2, the phrase "the goal is not to declare one method superior" most nearly means that the author


A) believes one method is clearly better.


B) thinks note-taking is unnecessary.


C) wants students to choose methods based on context rather than habit.


D) wants universities to ban physical notebooks.


Which choice best describes the relationship between the two passages?


A) Passage 1 offers a personal example that supports the more general claims made in Passage 2.


B) Passage 1 contradicts the research findings described in Passage 2.


C) Passage 2 summarizes the plot of Passage 1.


D) The passages discuss unrelated topics.


On which point would the authors most likely disagree?


A) Whether handwritten notes can help students see connections among ideas.


B) Whether students sometimes misuse laptops in class.


C) Whether laptops should be banned entirely from classrooms.


D) Whether summarizing information is part of note-taking.


The final sentence of Passage 2 ("The goal is not… intentional choices.") mainly serves to


A) introduce a new criticism of laptops.


B) clarify that the author advocates flexibility and strategy in choosing note-taking methods.


C) argue that digital notes are always more efficient.


D) suggest that students should avoid changing their habits.
