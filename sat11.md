SAT PRACTICE TEST 11


SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


The night before the piano competition, Lena practiced the same piece for the twentieth time. Her fingers traced the keys automatically, but her mind lagged behind, stumbling over what-ifs.


When she was eight, playing for relatives in a crowded living room, wrong notes had made everyone laugh. Now, at seventeen, they felt heavy, like evidence. Her teacher claimed the judges wanted "expression, not perfection," but the red circles on her sheet music suggested otherwise.


Lena stopped mid-measure and let the chord fade. She realized she could no longer tell whether she was playing the piece because she loved it or because she was afraid not to. Tomorrow, under bright lights and a silent audience, she would find out.


The passage primarily explores the narrator's experience of


A) the evolution of musical performance standards from childhood to professional competitions and how expectations change over time.


B) the psychological tension between intrinsic motivation and external validation, where artistic expression becomes entangled with self-worth measurement.


C) the stylistic differences between informal family performances and formal competitive settings, highlighting how context shapes musical interpretation.


D) the technical mastery required for advanced repertoire and the physical challenges of maintaining precision under performance pressure.


Which choice provides the best evidence for the answer to the previous question?


A) "The night before the piano competition, Lena practiced the same piece for the twentieth time."


B) "When she was eight, playing for relatives in a crowded living room, wrong notes had made everyone laugh."


C) "Her teacher claimed the judges wanted 'expression, not perfection…'"


D) "Now, at seventeen, they felt heavy, like evidence."


In the passage, the phrase "her mind lagged behind, stumbling over what-ifs" most nearly suggests that Lena


A) finds the repetitive practice monotonous and struggles to maintain engagement with familiar material.


B) experiences cognitive interference where muscle memory functions automatically while her conscious mind becomes preoccupied with potential negative outcomes.


C) is mentally rehearsing various scenarios and possible consequences rather than focusing on the present moment of performance.


D) attempts to process new musical information during execution, creating a disconnect between learning and performing.


The description of Lena's childhood performances ("wrong notes had made everyone laugh") primarily serves to


A) illustrate how family members viewed musical mistakes as endearing rather than consequential, establishing a baseline of acceptance.


B) establish a temporal contrast between an environment where errors were met with affectionate humor and her current reality where mistakes carry evaluative weight and personal significance.


C) demonstrate that early training lacked the discipline necessary for serious musical development, suggesting a missed opportunity for rigorous preparation.


D) reveal her preference for intimate, supportive performance contexts over formal competitive environments that demand perfection.


Which inference about Lena is best supported by the passage?


A) She has reached a point where she questions the sustainability of continuing piano if it remains tied to external validation rather than personal fulfillment.


B) She experiences uncertainty about whether her continued engagement with piano stems from genuine artistic passion or from fear of failure and the need to prove her worth through performance.


C) She anticipates that the judging process will be biased against her, leading her to doubt the fairness of competitive evaluation systems.


D) She regrets her instrument choice and imagines that selecting a different musical path might have led to greater satisfaction and less pressure.


The tone of the passage is best described as


A) wryly observant with moments of gentle irony that highlight the absurdity of performance anxiety.


B) frustrated and accusatory, pointing blame at the competitive system and its evaluative pressures.


C) resolute and confident, suggesting that determination will overcome obstacles and lead to success.


D) contemplative and anxious, capturing the internal conflict and psychological weight of performance expectations through reflective, measured prose.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


In recent years, remote work has shifted from a rare perk to a common arrangement. Surveys show that many employees value the flexibility to choose when and where they work. Some report better focus at home, while others appreciate avoiding long commutes.


However, not all jobs are equally suited to remote work. Positions that depend on physical presence—such as nursing, manufacturing, and food service—cannot simply move online. Even for office jobs, managers worry about maintaining team cohesion and mentoring early-career employees who may feel disconnected through screens.


Rather than treating remote work as a universal solution or a temporary fad, some organizations are experimenting with "hybrid" models. In these arrangements, employees spend part of the week in the office and part working elsewhere. Early data suggest that hybrid schedules can preserve in-person collaboration while still offering flexibility.


The primary purpose of the passage is to


A) advocate for a complete transition to remote work arrangements, arguing that technological advances make physical offices obsolete and that employee preferences should drive organizational change.


B) examine the growing prevalence of remote work arrangements, identify both advantages and limitations of fully remote models, and present hybrid approaches as potential solutions that address multiple concerns simultaneously.


C) demonstrate that remote work negatively impacts productivity, collaboration, and employee development across all industries and job categories without exception.


D) encourage organizations to return to traditional office-based work models, emphasizing the superior benefits of in-person interaction and dismissing remote work as a temporary trend.


According to the passage, which factor limits the spread of remote work?


A) Workers find digital communication tools inadequate substitutes for face-to-face interaction and resist adopting screen-based collaboration methods.


B) Research consistently shows that remote work arrangements result in decreased output and efficiency compared to traditional office settings.


C) Certain occupations fundamentally depend on physical presence and direct interaction with materials, equipment, or people, making remote work structurally impossible for those roles.


D) The financial costs associated with implementing hybrid work models, including technology infrastructure and space reconfiguration, exceed what most organizations can afford.


The author distinguishes between fully remote work and hybrid models primarily to


A) demonstrate that hybrid arrangements have lower adoption rates and less employee satisfaction compared to fully remote options.


B) establish that complete remote work is fundamentally unworkable and that some form of in-person presence is always necessary for organizational success.


C) indicate that hybrid schedules represent a compromise that employees accept reluctantly when full remote work is unavailable, rather than a preferred option.


D) highlight how certain organizations are exploring solutions that combine elements of both remote and in-person work to address multiple competing needs and concerns.


Which inference is best supported by the passage?


A) Different work arrangements suit different contexts, and a one-size-fits-all solution fails to account for the varied requirements of different industries, roles, and individual preferences.


B) The shift toward remote work represents a temporary phenomenon that will reverse as organizations recognize the limitations and return to traditional office-based models.


C) Hybrid work models completely resolve issues of employee isolation and disconnection that arise in fully remote environments, providing perfect solutions to all remote work challenges.


D) Most workers find daily office commutes preferable to remote work options, valuing the routine and structure that traditional work arrangements provide.


The author's attitude toward remote and hybrid work can best be described as


A) unreservedly positive, presenting remote work as an unqualified improvement over traditional arrangements without addressing potential drawbacks.


B) fundamentally negative, treating remote work as a problematic trend that undermines workplace effectiveness and should be avoided.


C) measured and analytical, recognizing both the advantages that remote work offers to certain employees and the limitations that prevent it from being universally applicable, while exploring hybrid solutions.


D) neutral and disengaged, presenting information without taking a position or expressing interest in the implications of different work arrangements.


Which choice best describes the structure of the passage?


A) An anecdotal example from an individual's experience provides empirical evidence that validates a broader scientific principle about work arrangements.


B) A contemporary development is presented, followed by analysis of constraints and challenges it faces, concluding with exploration of alternative solutions that address multiple concerns.


C) A workplace challenge is identified and analyzed, leading to a conclusive resolution that eliminates all associated difficulties and provides a definitive answer.


D) Multiple distinct workplace phenomena are introduced sequentially without establishing connections or relationships between them.


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


A researcher investigated how temperature affects the rate of a simple chemical reaction. She ran the reaction at four different temperatures and measured the average reaction time (in seconds) for a visible color change to occur.


The results are described as follows:


 • At 10°C, the reaction took 40 seconds on average.


 • At 20°C, the reaction took 24 seconds on average.


 • At 30°C, the reaction took 15 seconds on average.


 • At 40°C, the reaction took 12 seconds on average.


Based on these data, the researcher concluded that increasing temperature generally decreases reaction time, though the size of the change in reaction time is not the same at every temperature increase.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) establish that chemical reactions universally cease functioning when temperatures exceed 40 degrees Celsius, demonstrating an absolute temperature limit.


B) present experimental methodology and results that demonstrate the relationship between temperature variation and the rate at which a chemical reaction proceeds, including observations about the pattern of change.


C) analyze the differences between reaction mechanisms in liquid versus gaseous states and how phase affects temperature sensitivity.


D) demonstrate that elevated temperatures are necessary prerequisites for initiating chemical transformations and that low temperatures prevent reactions entirely.


Between which pair of temperatures does the reaction time decrease by the greatest number of seconds?


A) 10°C and 20°C


B) 20°C and 30°C


C) 10°C and 30°C


D) 30°C and 40°C


Compared with the reaction at 20°C, the reaction at 30°C


A) requires a greater duration to reach completion, indicating that higher temperatures slow reaction progress.


B) reaches completion in less time, demonstrating that increased temperature accelerates the reaction process.


C) exhibits identical completion times, suggesting that temperature changes within this range have negligible effects on reaction kinetics.


D) produces results that fall outside measurable parameters, making comparison impossible with available instrumentation.


The data most strongly support which statement?


A) Reaction duration increases in a linear, predictable manner as temperature rises, following a consistent mathematical relationship.


B) No discernible pattern connects temperature variations to reaction timing, indicating that these variables operate independently.


C) Elevated temperatures tend to correlate with reduced reaction durations, though the magnitude of change varies across different temperature intervals rather than following a uniform pattern.


D) Each 10-degree temperature increase produces exactly a 50% reduction in reaction time, creating a precise halving effect that applies consistently across all temperature ranges.


Suppose the researcher tested the reaction at 50°C. Which prediction is most reasonable based on the pattern in the data?


A) The reaction would take exactly 4 seconds.


B) The reaction time would likely be somewhat shorter than 12 seconds but not drop to zero.


C) The reaction time would return to 40 seconds.


D) The reaction would no longer occur.


Which sentence from the passage best supports the idea that the effect of temperature change is not identical at each step?


A) "A researcher investigated how temperature affects the rate of a simple chemical reaction."


B) "She ran the reaction at four different temperatures…"


C) "Based on these data, the researcher concluded that increasing temperature generally decreases reaction time, though the size of the change in reaction time is not the same at every temperature increase."


D) "The results are described as follows…"


If the data were graphed with temperature on the horizontal axis and reaction time on the vertical axis, the line of best fit would most likely have


A) an upward-sloping trend, indicating that increased temperature values correspond to increased reaction duration measurements.


B) a downward-sloping trend, showing that as temperature increases along the horizontal axis, reaction time decreases along the vertical axis.


C) a horizontal line with no slope, demonstrating that reaction time remains constant regardless of temperature variations.


D) a complex pattern with segments that slope upward and downward in alternating sequence, reflecting inconsistent temperature-time relationships.


In the context of this passage, the word "effect" in "effect of temperature" most nearly refers to


A) the visual characteristics and physical properties of the temperature-measuring instrument used in the experiment.


B) the underlying mechanism or factor that initiates and drives the chemical reaction process itself.


C) the measurable impact or influence that variations in temperature exert on the duration required for the reaction to proceed to completion.


D) the subjective interpretation or evaluative judgment that the researcher forms regarding the experimental outcomes and their significance.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages (Humanities / Education)


Passage 1


When I take notes by hand, my pages look messy—arrows connecting ideas, comments squeezed into margins, entire paragraphs crossed out and rewritten. Typing on a laptop, by contrast, produces neat rows of text that could almost be mistaken for a finished essay.


Yet my messy notebook is where understanding happens. Writing slowly forces me to choose what matters instead of trying to capture every word the speaker says. Later, when I flip through those pages, the odd spacing and quick sketches remind me how ideas fit together. I am not just recording information; I am building a map of my thinking in real time.


Passage 2


College instructors increasingly see laptops in their classrooms, and the change is not purely positive. Some students use devices to follow along with slides, but others drift into email or social media. Studies comparing handwritten and typed notes suggest that students who type are more likely to copy lectures verbatim, while students who write by hand tend to summarize and reorganize ideas.


This does not mean laptops should be banned. Instead, educators might teach students how and when to use different note-taking tools. For complex discussions, handwritten notes may help students process ideas more deeply. For courses that require large amounts of factual detail, carefully structured digital notes can be useful. The goal is not to declare one method superior but to encourage intentional choices.


Both passages most strongly suggest that


A) digital note-taking consistently interferes with learning and should be eliminated from all educational contexts regardless of circumstances.


B) handwritten notes possess superior organizational qualities and visual clarity compared to digitally produced text, making them inherently more effective.


C) the method students employ for capturing information during lectures influences their cognitive engagement, comprehension depth, and ability to synthesize material.


D) educational institutions should implement universal bans on laptop computers in classroom settings to prevent distraction and improve learning outcomes.


The central claim of Passage 2 is that


A) digital devices represent the future of education and should completely supplant traditional notebook-based note-taking systems in academic settings.


B) different note-taking approaches serve distinct purposes and can be valuable when selected intentionally based on learning goals, course content, and cognitive objectives.


C) educators must implement disciplinary measures against students who engage with non-academic digital content during instructional time to maintain classroom focus.


D) the specific technique used for recording information has no measurable impact on student comprehension, retention, or academic performance outcomes.


Compared with the tone of Passage 2, the tone of Passage 1 is more


A) objective and removed, presenting information without emotional investment or personal perspective.


B) reflective and intimate, drawing on personal experience and emotional connection to convey insights about the note-taking process.


C) negative and antagonistic, expressing frustration and opposition toward alternative approaches or competing viewpoints.


D) specialized and academic, employing technical terminology and formal language structures typical of scholarly discourse.


Which choice provides the best evidence in Passage 2 that handwritten notes may support deeper thinking?


A) "College instructors increasingly see laptops in their classrooms…"


B) "Some students use devices to follow along with slides…"


C) "Studies comparing handwritten and typed notes suggest that students who type are more likely to copy lectures verbatim, while students who write by hand tend to summarize and reorganize ideas."


D) "This does not mean laptops should be banned."


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) laptop computers have no legitimate place in lecture settings and should be completely excluded from classroom environments.


B) effective note-taking involves active processing, selection, and organization of information rather than verbatim transcription of all spoken content.


C) digital note-taking methods produce superior learning outcomes compared to handwritten approaches across all academic contexts and subject areas.


D) educational institutions should mandate uniform note-taking techniques for all courses to ensure consistency and standardization.


In Passage 1, the author's description of "arrows connecting ideas" and "comments squeezed into margins" primarily serves to


A) acknowledge deficiencies in penmanship and calligraphic skills that detract from note quality and readability.


B) demonstrate that the author fails to maintain focus during instructional periods and engages in tangential activities.


C) exemplify how handwritten notes capture the dynamic, non-linear process of actively synthesizing, connecting, and restructuring information during learning.


D) indicate that the author lacks genuine engagement with course material and approaches learning with indifference or apathy.


In Passage 2, the phrase "the goal is not to declare one method superior" most nearly means that the author


A) actually considers one approach definitively superior but chooses not to state this conclusion explicitly.


B) considers note-taking practices irrelevant to learning outcomes and believes students can succeed without recording information.


C) advocates for intentional selection of note-taking strategies that match specific learning contexts, course requirements, and cognitive objectives rather than defaulting to habitual approaches.


D) recommends that educational institutions eliminate traditional paper-based notebooks in favor of exclusively digital documentation systems.


Which choice best describes the relationship between the two passages?


A) Passage 1 provides an individual, experiential perspective that illustrates and reinforces the broader, research-based observations and recommendations presented in Passage 2.


B) Passage 1 presents evidence or viewpoints that directly conflict with or undermine the scientific findings and conclusions reported in Passage 2.


C) Passage 2 condenses the narrative events, character development, and story progression contained within Passage 1 into a brief synopsis.


D) The passages address completely separate subjects with no thematic, conceptual, or substantive connections between them.


On which point would the authors most likely disagree?


A) Whether handwritten note-taking methods facilitate students' ability to identify relationships, patterns, and connections between different concepts and pieces of information.


B) Whether students occasionally engage in inappropriate or non-academic uses of laptop computers during instructional periods.


C) Whether educational institutions should implement complete prohibitions on laptop computers in classroom environments, eliminating all digital devices regardless of context or purpose.


D) Whether the process of condensing and synthesizing information into concise summaries represents an essential component of effective note-taking practices.


The final sentence of Passage 2 ("The goal is not… intentional choices.") mainly serves to


A) present an additional negative assessment of laptop computers and their detrimental effects on classroom learning environments.


B) emphasize that the author supports adaptable, context-aware selection of note-taking approaches rather than rigid adherence to a single method, encouraging strategic decision-making.


C) establish that digital note-taking systems consistently produce superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to all alternative approaches.


D) recommend that students maintain their existing note-taking routines without modification, avoiding experimentation with different techniques.
