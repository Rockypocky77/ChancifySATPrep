SAT PRACTICE TEST 6

SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)

Questions 1–6: Literature Passage
The Weight of Inheritance

The attic smelled of cardboard and decades. My aunt handed me a shoebox—my grandfather's letters from the war. I'd never met him. He died before I was born, yet his silence shaped our family like negative space shapes sculpture.

"He never talked about it," my aunt said. "Not once."

Inside, forty letters to my grandmother. The handwriting was careful, the sentences short. Weather is fine. Food adequate. Hope you're well. Nothing about fear, death, or the friends whose names appeared early then vanished from later letters.

My grandmother kept every letter but never mentioned them. She died last spring, and now this inheritance: proof of love expressed through persistent silence.

I thought about what we inherit—not just letters and silverware, but patterns. My father never discussed his childhood. I struggle to articulate emotions. Three generations learning that some things remain unspeakable, even when speaking might save us.

The passage primarily focuses on

A) comprehensive documentation of specific military engagements during World War II
B) the intergenerational transmission of unarticulated psychological trauma through behavioral patterns
C) recognition of the grandfather's distinguished military service and achievements
D) the historical significance and cultural value of written correspondence

The phrase "negative space shapes sculpture" suggests

A) the grandfather maintained artistic pursuits involving sculptural media and creative expression
B) what is absent or unspoken can exert comparable influence to what is present or expressed
C) family members deliberately minimized interpersonal contact and avoided communication
D) sculptural artworks represented significant inherited family possessions and valuable heirlooms

The grandfather's letters are significant because they

A) provide detailed accounts of tactical military planning and execution during wartime operations
B) contain profound contemplations on existential and philosophical questions about human nature
C) exemplify the emotional containment and verbal economy that defined his communicative style
D) establish evidence of exceptional literary talent and writing ability beyond ordinary correspondence

As used in context, "inheritance" means

A) financial assets distributed according to legal testamentary documents
B) exclusively biological characteristics transmitted through genetic mechanisms
C) behavioral templates and psychological patterns transmitted across family generations
D) solely material possessions and tangible artifacts

The narrator's adult reflection suggests

A) maintaining silence consistently safeguards family relationships and stability
B) verbal articulation of traumatic experiences serves no therapeutic or relational purpose
C) unprocessed emotional pain may contribute to the continuation of maladaptive behavioral cycles
D) earlier generations possessed superior wisdom and judgment

The tone of the passage is best described as

A) exuberant and characterized by positive emotional expression
B) contemplative and tinged with a sense of loss or sadness
C) characterized by resentment and hostile emotional undertones
D) objective and emotionally neutral in presentation


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage
The Attention Economy

Social media platforms don't sell products—they sell attention. Users are not customers; they're inventory. Advertisers are customers. This inverted relationship explains platform design: features maximize engagement, not user wellbeing.

Infinite scroll eliminates natural stopping points. Autoplay videos prevent pause. Notifications create intermittent reinforcement—the same mechanism that makes slot machines addictive. These aren't bugs; they're features.

Former employees reveal design meetings focused on "time on site" metrics. Every second watching screens generates ad revenue. One designer described building features explicitly intended to exploit psychological vulnerabilities.

The consequences are measurable. Teenage depression rates correlate with smartphone adoption. Average attention spans decreased from 12 seconds (2000) to 8 seconds (2013). We check phones 96 times daily—once every ten minutes during waking hours.

Some defend this as market innovation. Platforms provide free services; attention is payment. But we never consented to this transaction. No warning label says: "This product is engineered to manipulate your dopamine system."

Regulation faces challenges. Platforms claim algorithmic neutrality, but choices—what content surfaces, which features exist—reflect values. Transparency could help. Requiring platforms to disclose manipulation techniques might enable informed choices. Or perhaps attention, like labor, deserves legal protections.

The passage primarily

A) celebrates social media innovation
B) examines how platforms exploit attention for profit
C) teaches users to design platforms
D) proves social media benefits users

"Users are not customers; they're inventory" means

A) users have no value
B) platforms sell user attention to advertisers
C) customers must purchase accounts
D) inventory management is important

Infinite scroll is designed to

A) improve user experience through convenience
B) save server storage
C) eliminate stopping points and prolong engagement
D) showcase more news stories

The comparison to slot machines suggests

A) gambling is common on social media
B) platforms use addictive psychological mechanisms
C) users win prizes
D) platforms operate in casinos

Those defending the attention economy argue

A) depression rates are unrelated
B) attention as payment for free services is fair
C) regulation already exists
D) platforms should charge subscription fees

The author suggests regulation might involve

A) banning social media entirely
B) requiring transparency about manipulative design
C) forcing platforms to pay users
D) eliminating all advertising


Questions 13–18: Natural Science Passage
CRISPR and Genetic Engineering Ethics

CRISPR-Cas9 enables precise DNA editing. Scientists can delete, insert, or modify genes with unprecedented accuracy. This technology promises to cure genetic diseases—sickle cell anemia, Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis.

In 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced he'd edited embryos to confer HIV resistance. The resulting twins became the first genetically modified humans. The scientific community responded with condemnation—not because CRISPR doesn't work, but because germline editing (changes that transfer to offspring) crosses ethical boundaries.

Somatic editing (modifying adult cells) treats individuals without affecting future generations. Germline editing alters humanity's genetic inheritance. Once introduced, modifications propagate through populations indefinitely.

Safety concerns are immediate. Off-target effects—unintended edits elsewhere in the genome—could cause unforeseen problems. We understand individual genes poorly; complex traits involve thousands of genetic interactions.

Equity issues loom large. If genetic enhancement becomes available, wealthy families might edit children for intelligence, athleticism, or appearance. This could create genetic castes, transforming social inequality into biological destiny.

Some argue enhancement is human nature—we've always sought advantages through education, nutrition, and medicine. But genetic modification differs fundamentally: changes are permanent, irreversible, and heritable.

International consensus favors somatic therapy but opposes germline editing until safety and ethical frameworks exist. Whether humanity can maintain this restraint remains uncertain.

The passage primarily

A) advocates unrestricted genetic engineering
B) presents CRISPR capabilities and explores ethical dilemmas
C) explains detailed laboratory techniques
D) argues genetic modification should be banned

He Jiankui's experiment generated controversy because

A) CRISPR technology failed
B) germline editing affects future generations without consent
C) HIV resistance is undesirable
D) the twins were unhealthy

Somatic editing differs from germline editing in that

A) somatic editing is more expensive
B) somatic changes don't transfer to offspring
C) somatic editing is less effective
D) somatic editing is illegal

"Off-target effects" refer to

A) intended genetic modifications
B) successful disease treatments
C) unintended edits at wrong genome locations
D) modifications that work too well

The concern about "genetic castes" suggests

A) enhancement could deepen biological inequality
B) all genetic modification creates social classes
C) wealthy families oppose enhancement
D) current society lacks inequality

As used in context, "heritable" means

A) expensive
B) passed to descendants
C) difficult to achieve
D) medically significant


Questions 19–24: Humanities Passage
The Museum's Dilemma

Museums face an identity crisis. Founded as temples preserving civilization's treasures, they now confront questions about whose civilization and which treasures.

The British Museum houses the Parthenon Marbles, removed from Athens in the early 1800s by Lord Elgin. Greece demands return. Britain claims legal acquisition and superior preservation. This debate encapsulates colonialism's legacy.

Acquisition often occurred under dubious circumstances. Colonial powers didn't purchase artifacts through fair negotiation—they extracted them from occupied territories. Museums became repositories of imperial plunder.

Encyclopedic museums argue they provide global access to world culture. A Nigerian visiting London can see Benin Bronzes; a Korean in Paris can examine ancient scrolls. Repatriation scatters collections, they claim, limiting educational access.

But this argument assumes Western institutions are culturally neutral spaces. They're not. Display choices, interpretive text, and contextual framing reflect specific cultural perspectives. Egyptian artifacts in Western museums become exotic curiosities rather than living heritage.

Increasingly, source countries demand repatriation, asserting cultural property rights. France recently returned artifacts to Benin. Germany negotiates about Nefertiti. The process is contentious and slow.

Some propose compromise: long-term loans with shared ownership, rotating displays, or digital replication. Yet these don't address the fundamental issue: museums built on colonial extraction must reckon with that history.

The passage primarily examines

A) museum architecture
B) ethical debates over colonial-era artifact ownership
C) Greek sculpture techniques
D) tourism to major museums

The Parthenon Marbles example illustrates

A) successful international cooperation
B) conflicts over artifacts acquired during colonialism
C) superior British preservation methods
D) ancient Greek maritime trade

Encyclopedic museums defend retaining artifacts by arguing

A) source countries are unstable
B) artifacts are legally purchased
C) global access benefits education
D) preservation costs are too high

The author suggests Western display contexts

A) accurately represent all cultures equally
B) impose specific cultural interpretations
C) are superior to original contexts
D) attract more visitors

Recent actions by France and Germany indicate

A) all artifacts will be returned immediately
B) some institutions are beginning to repatriate collections
C) European museums are closing
D) repatriation is universally rejected

As used in context, "reckon with" means

A) calculate
B) ignore
C) confront and acknowledge
D) celebrate


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Standardized Testing
Passage 1

Standardized tests provide objective measurement in an increasingly subjective education landscape. Without common benchmarks, comparing students across schools, districts, and states becomes impossible.

Teacher grades vary wildly. One school's A student might struggle with another's curriculum. Grade inflation—average GPA rose from 2.68 (1990) to 3.11 (2019)—makes transcripts meaningless for college admissions.

Tests measure fundamental skills: reading comprehension, mathematical reasoning, analytical writing. These abilities matter for college success. Research shows test scores predict first-year college GPA better than high school grades.

Critics claim tests favor privileged students who afford preparation courses. But the alternative—relying on extracurriculars, essays, and recommendations—advantages the wealthy even more. Elite students access expensive private counselors, music lessons, and exotic volunteer opportunities. Tests at least measure something related to academics.

Test-optional policies sound progressive but evidence suggests they harm disadvantaged students. Without scores, admissions rely more heavily on subjective factors correlating with socioeconomic status. First-generation college students benefit from concrete metrics proving readiness.

Passage 2

Standardized tests don't measure intelligence—they measure test-taking ability and socioeconomic privilege. Score gaps between racial and economic groups reflect access disparities, not inherent differences.

Wealthy families spend thousands on tutoring. Companies like Princeton Review promise score increases—and deliver. This proves tests measure preparation, not aptitude. Students taking the SAT multiple times increase scores through familiarity with question patterns.

What tests claim to measure—critical thinking, problem-solving—they assess poorly. Timed multiple-choice formats reward quick pattern recognition, not deep understanding. A student who methodically considers complex problems struggles compared to one who rapidly eliminates wrong answers.

The stress tests inflict damages students psychologically. High-stakes testing correlates with increased anxiety and depression. Students internalize scores as measures of worth.

Test-optional schools show diverse, successful student bodies. Bowdoin College dropped testing requirements in 1969. Their students graduate at identical rates whether or not they submitted scores. This demonstrates tests aren't necessary for predicting success.

We should evaluate students holistically: grades over four years, recommendation letters, demonstrated interests, and personal essays. These reveal character, persistence, and genuine ability better than a single Saturday morning exam.

Both passages would likely agree

A) tests perfectly measure intelligence
B) there are concerns about equity in college admissions
C) test-optional policies help all students
D) grades are completely objective

Passage 1's main argument for testing is

A) tests are entertaining
B) tests generate revenue
C) tests provide objective comparison across varied contexts
D) tests are required by law

Passage 2 argues score gaps between groups reflect

A) genetic differences
B) access to resources rather than ability
C) lack of effort
D) regional differences

How would Passage 1 respond to test preparation concerns?

A) Deny preparation courses exist
B) Argue alternatives advantage wealthy students even more
C) Support banning all test preparation
D) Agree tests should be eliminated

Unlike Passage 1, Passage 2 emphasizes

A) grade inflation statistics
B) college success predictions
C) psychological harm from high-stakes testing
D) objective measurement benefits

The passages' relationship:

A) Both oppose standardized testing
B) Passage 1 defends tests, Passage 2 opposes them on equity and validity grounds
C) Both support testing but disagree on implementation
D) Passage 2 refutes statistical claims Passage 1 never makes
