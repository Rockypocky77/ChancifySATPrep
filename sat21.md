Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


The Night Market


By the time most of my classmates are finishing homework or scrolling through their phones, I'm rolling up the metal gate of our family stall at the night market. The air smells like frying oil and garlic, like sugar and smoke. My father says this is the smell of opportunity; my mother says it's the smell that clings to your clothes no matter how many times you wash them.


Our stall sells skewers—chicken, lamb, tofu, mushrooms brushed with my father's secret sauce. I've known the recipe since I was twelve, but he still calls it his sauce, as if admitting I know it would mean admitting I might not always be here to use it.


"University isn't a ladder away from us," he told me last week. "It's a circle. You'll come back around." He said it lightly, like a joke. I laughed, like it was one. But the acceptance email from the engineering program in the city burned quietly in my pocket.


Between bursts of customers, I do physics problems beside the grill. The notebook's edges curl from the steam. Sometimes a teacher walks past and does a double take—as if my equations don't belong next to skewers and plastic stools.


My little brother loves the market. He darts between stalls, trading leftover skewers for candied fruit, coming back sticky and proud of his bargains. "When I'm big," he told me, "you can be the boss and I'll take orders." I pictured that future the way my parents did: familiar, crowded, safe. Then I pictured myself in a lab, surrounded by machines I don't yet know how to name.


The market closes at midnight. We scrub the grill, stack stools, pull the gate down again. My father pats my shoulder. "One day this will all be yours," he says.


I look at the dark metal and think: maybe that's the problem. I want something that isn't already waiting for me.

Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


Designing the "15-Minute City"


Urban planners increasingly promote the idea of the "15-minute city"—a neighborhood where residents can access most daily needs within a fifteen-minute walk or bike ride. Schools, groceries, clinics, parks, and workplaces would cluster close enough that cars become optional rather than mandatory.


Advocates argue this model addresses multiple problems at once. Shorter commutes reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. Local shops benefit from steady nearby customers. Social connections strengthen when residents frequently encounter neighbors on sidewalks instead of passing them at high speed through windshields.


A city government recently surveyed three districts to see how close they were to this ideal. The results are summarized as follows:


District A: 80% of residents live within a 15-minute walk of a grocery store, 70% of a school, and 40% of a clinic.


District B: 60% of residents live within a 15-minute walk of a grocery store, 90% of a school, and 85% of a clinic.


District C: 45% of residents live within a 15-minute walk of a grocery store, 50% of a school, and 30% of a clinic.


Planners concluded that District B most closely matches the 15-minute vision for essential services, while District C lags farthest behind.


Critics raise concerns. Concentrating amenities in already desirable neighborhoods can accelerate gentrification, pushing out lower-income residents. If not paired with affordable housing policies, "15-minute" convenience may become a luxury rather than a right. Others worry about surveillance—denser, walkable areas often involve more cameras and data collection in the name of safety.


Still, the concept reshapes how cities define success. Instead of asking how quickly cars move through streets, planners ask how easily people can reach what they need without cars at all.


The passage primarily


A) describes a new brand of electric vehicles


B) explains the goals and complications of the "15-minute city" model


C) argues against public transportation


D) compares rural and urban lifestyles


Based on the survey data, planners considered District B closest to the 15-minute ideal because it


A) has the shortest commute times by car


B) has relatively high walkable access to all three key services


C) has the most grocery stores per block


D) is the wealthiest district


In context, the example of "passing them at high speed through windshields" (paragraph 2) emphasizes that the 15-minute city


A) increases car sales


B) reduces pedestrian safety


C) replaces face-to-face interactions with online communication


D) encourages slower, more personal contact among neighbors


The concern about gentrification suggests that


A) improving neighborhoods can unintentionally displace existing residents


B) walkable areas are always more affordable


C) planners do not care about housing


D) grocery stores cause rent to decrease


The mention of cameras and data collection supports which broader idea in the passage?


A) No city can ever be safe.


B) Efforts to improve urban life can introduce new trade-offs and privacy concerns.


C) Technology automatically makes neighborhoods walkable.


D) Fifteen-minute cities require no regulation.


The final paragraph indicates a shift from


A) measuring city success by vehicle efficiency to measuring it by human access to resources


B) rural planning to highway construction


C) environmental issues to school reform


D) public criticism to complete rejection of the model


Questions 13–18: Natural Science Passage


Dark Matter and Galaxy Rotation


When astronomers measured how fast stars orbit the centers of galaxies, they expected outer stars to move more slowly than inner stars, just as distant planets orbit the Sun more slowly than nearby ones. Instead, in many galaxies, outer stars moved almost as fast as inner ones. This unexpected pattern suggested a hidden mass—dark matter—extending well beyond visible stars.


Imagine a simple description of their data from one spiral galaxy:


At 5,000 light-years (inner region), the star's orbital speed is 200 km/s.


At 15,000 light-years (middle region), the speed is 210 km/s.


At 30,000 light-years (outer region), the speed is 205 km/s.


If only visible stars contributed to gravity, speeds at 30,000 light-years should be much lower than those near 5,000 light-years. Instead, the speeds remain nearly "flat" across the galaxy. The most straightforward explanation is additional, unseen matter whose gravity holds fast-moving outer stars in orbit.


Dark matter has never been directly observed. It doesn't emit light, absorb it, or reflect it. Its existence is inferred from gravitational effects: how galaxies rotate, how light bends around massive clusters, and how large-scale structures formed in the early universe.


Alternative theories propose modifying gravity itself rather than invoking invisible matter. These models attempt to explain galaxy rotation without dark matter but often struggle to account for all observations simultaneously. For now, dark matter remains the prevailing explanation—and one of modern astronomy's biggest mysteries.


The passage primarily


A) explains how dark matter helps account for unusual galaxy rotation speeds


B) argues that planets orbit stars at constant speeds


C) describes how telescopes are built


D) proves that alternative gravity theories are correct


The data about star speeds at different distances mainly support which conclusion?


A) Inner stars move much faster than outer stars.


B) Orbital speeds remain surprisingly similar at different distances from the galaxy's center.


C) Outer stars barely move at all.


D) Only visible stars determine a galaxy's gravitational field.


In context, the word "flat" most nearly means


A) two-dimensional


B) dangerously low


C) relatively constant across distances


D) perfectly motionless


The passage states that dark matter is inferred from


A) laboratory experiments with magnets


B) gravitational effects on stars and light


C) its bright glow in radio wavelengths


D) direct sampling by spacecraft


Alternative theories that "modify gravity itself" attempt to


A) eliminate the need to explain galaxy rotation


B) show that gravity doesn't exist


C) explain observations without assuming invisible matter


D) prove galaxies are not rotating


The author's attitude toward dark matter can best be described as


A) dismissive, because it has never been seen


B) uncritical, accepting it without evidence


C) cautiously supportive, acknowledging it as the leading but still mysterious explanation


D) hostile, favoring alternative theories


Questions 19–24: Humanities Passage


Why Public Libraries Still Matter


In an age when nearly any fact appears a few keystrokes away, public libraries might seem obsolete. Yet they persist—and, in many communities, thrive. The reason is simple: libraries have never been just about books.


A library is one of the few indoor spaces where you can sit without being expected to buy anything. People experiencing homelessness find warmth and internet access. Students gather at tables to work on group projects. Job seekers use public computers to search listings and print résumés. Children attend story time while caregivers find a quiet moment on a nearby chair.


Critics sometimes argue that these functions distract from libraries' "real" purpose as repositories of literature and knowledge. But librarians see the mission differently. Providing access—to information, to technology, to safe space—is precisely the point. The shelves are only one part of the infrastructure that makes that access possible.


During natural disasters and heat waves, some libraries serve as cooling centers and charging hubs. When local newspapers shut down, libraries archive community history and host forums. In many small towns, the library is the last remaining civic space that belongs to everyone and no one at once.


As budgets tighten, these institutions face difficult choices: extend hours or buy more e-books? Hire another children's librarian or upgrade computers? The debate is not about whether libraries matter—it is about which of their many roles to prioritize with limited resources.


The passage primarily argues that public libraries


A) should be replaced with online databases


B) remain essential community spaces far beyond their role as book repositories


C) are mainly valuable for preserving rare manuscripts


D) function best when they restrict non-reading activities


The phrase "belongs to everyone and no one at once" (paragraph 4) suggests that libraries


A) lack clear ownership and are illegal


B) are private spaces controlled by donors


C) are open, shared civic spaces not dominated by any single group


D) are often empty


The examples of people using libraries for warmth, internet access, and job searches (paragraph 2) primarily serve to


A) prove that books are no longer needed


B) show how libraries provide practical support to diverse community members


C) criticize people who don't read


D) argue that libraries should charge small fees


Critics' view that non-book activities "distract" from libraries' purpose is challenged by the author's claim that


A) libraries should close on weekends


B) access itself—whether to space, technology, or information—is central to the library mission


C) librarians prefer quiet over programming


D) story time should be eliminated


The description of libraries as cooling centers and disaster hubs best supports which idea?


A) Libraries are poorly insulated.


B) Libraries play flexible roles responding to local needs.


C) Only large cities maintain libraries.


D) Libraries cause natural disasters.


The author suggests that current debates about library budgets are mainly about


A) whether libraries should exist


B) which of many important services should receive limited funding


C) how to privatize libraries


D) how to reduce staff salaries


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Homework Debate


Passage 1


Homework has become a symbol of academic seriousness. Parents ask, "How much homework will my child have?" as if the answer measures school quality. Yet decades of research suggest diminishing returns after a certain point. For elementary students, large homework loads show little connection to improved test scores.


Advocates argue that homework teaches responsibility and time management. Students must plan, prioritize, and complete tasks without constant supervision. This is true—but only when homework is purposeful and limited. Two thoughtfully designed problems can reinforce a concept; fifty nearly identical ones often just produce fatigue and resentment.


Excessive homework also widens inequality. Students with quiet bedrooms, reliable internet, and educated parents receive unspoken advantages. Those sharing small spaces with siblings or working part-time jobs complete assignments under far more strain. When grades heavily depend on homework, they may measure household circumstances as much as mastery.


Rather than eliminating homework entirely, schools should adopt "quality over quantity" policies: shorter, more targeted tasks with clear goals, paired with protections such as homework-free weekends and limits on total daily workload.


Passage 2


Calls to reduce homework overlook its essential role in education. Practice solidifies learning. A musician does not master an instrument by attending lessons alone; daily exercises at home transform skill. Academic work is no different.


Research linking homework to performance is complex, but it consistently finds moderate homework associated with better outcomes in middle and high school. Students who regularly review material outside class remember it longer and progress further in advanced coursework. Without structured practice, gaps widen between students who self-motivate and those who do not.


Concerns about inequality are valid but misdirected. The problem is not homework itself; it is lack of support. Schools can provide after-school study halls, peer tutoring, and resource centers to help students who lack quiet spaces or adult assistance at home. Removing homework entirely would lower expectations rather than expand opportunity.


Instead of shrinking homework, we should improve it—aligning assignments with course goals, training teachers in effective design, and communicating expectations clearly. Practice, done well, remains indispensable.


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) homework can reinforce learning when it is well designed


B) homework should be eliminated for all students


C) grades should be based only on tests


D) more homework always leads to better results


Passage 1 argues that large amounts of homework can


A) guarantee success for all students


B) produce fatigue and widen inequality


C) eliminate the need for tests


D) reduce the importance of teaching quality


Passage 2's comparison between musicians and students primarily serves to


A) criticize music education


B) show that academic skill, like musical skill, requires regular practice outside formal instruction


C) suggest that homework should focus on the arts


D) argue that only talented people need homework


How would Passage 2 most likely respond to Passage 1's claim that homework widens inequality?


A) Agree fully and call for abolishing homework


B) Argue that providing better support systems is preferable to removing homework


C) Deny that any students face challenges at home


D) Claim that inequality is unrelated to education


Unlike Passage 2, Passage 1 emphasizes


A) the importance of daily practice


B) policies such as homework-free weekends and workload limits


C) teacher training in assignment design


D) the benefits of advanced coursework


The relationship between the two passages is best described as


A) both rejecting homework entirely


B) one focusing on math homework and the other on reading homework


C) Passage 1 calling for limits on homework while Passage 2 defends its continued central role


D) both presenting identical views about homework
