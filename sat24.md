Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


The Last Practice


By the time the gym lights flickered off, everyone else had gone home. Only Coach Ramirez and I remained, the echo of bouncing balls replaced by the faint hum of the vending machine in the hallway.


"One more free throw," he said, rolling the ball back to me. His voice sounded casual, but we both knew this was it—the last practice before the state championship, my last game of high school, maybe the last organized game I would ever play.


I spun the ball in my hands, suddenly aware of everything they'd carried: years of early mornings, scraped knees on the driveway, my dad shouting advice from the porch until he got sick, and then the quiet after he didn't come outside anymore.


"You don't have to be perfect tomorrow," Coach said. "You just have to be yourself."


That sounded dangerous. Being myself meant caring too much. It meant remembering every shot I'd missed since fifth grade, every time I'd let a teammate down. But it also meant the feeling that rose in my chest whenever the ball left my fingers just right, like a promise keeping itself.


I took the shot. The ball arced, kissed the rim, and fell through the net with a whisper. Coach nodded once, like we'd agreed on something important without saying it out loud.


On the walk home, the cool air felt less like an ending and more like a held breath before whatever comes next.

A) strategies for winning basketball games and competitive tactics


B) the narrator's emotional experience facing an important transition


C) conflict between the narrator and Coach Ramirez and interpersonal tensions


D) the history of the state championship and tournament records


The description of the ball as carrying "years of early mornings, scraped knees… and then the quiet" suggests


A) the ball is too old to use and requires replacement


B) the narrator wants to quit basketball and abandon the sport


C) basketball is tied to personal memories, including the father's illness


D) the narrator prefers practicing alone and avoiding team interactions


Coach's statement, "You just have to be yourself," is dangerous to the narrator because


A) the narrator doesn't like basketball


B) the narrator associates "being themself" with overthinking and pressure


C) the narrator wants to change positions


D) the narrator plans to ignore instructions


The free throw that "fell through the net with a whisper" functions as


A) a sign the narrator has achieved perfection


B) a symbolic moment of quiet confidence before the game


C) proof the narrator will get a scholarship


D) evidence that the gym is empty


As used in the final paragraph, the phrase "a held breath before whatever comes next" suggests the narrator feels

Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


Remote Work and the Future of Cities


For more than a century, cities justified their high costs by concentrating opportunity. People tolerated cramped apartments and long commutes because offices, clients, and collaborators clustered downtown. The pandemic disrupted this bargain. Millions discovered they could work from kitchen tables in quieter neighborhoods—or different states entirely.


Not all jobs can be remote, of course. But among those that can, flexibility changed expectations. Surveys show that many workers now rank flexible schedules and hybrid arrangements alongside salary in importance. Some even accept lower pay in exchange for avoiding daily commutes.


Consider the following description of a chart from a recent study:


A bar graph compares average one-way commute times for three groups.


Group A: fully in-office workers—average 47 minutes.


Group B: hybrid workers—average 29 minutes.


Group C: fully remote workers—average 9 minutes (mostly occasional trips).


These differences matter. Commute time is strongly associated with stress, sleep quality, and civic engagement. Longer commutes correlate with lower rates of volunteering and participation in local events.


City planners face a puzzle. If remote workers visit downtown less often, restaurants, transit systems, and small businesses suffer. Yet empty offices create opportunity. Some cities are converting office towers into apartments, schools, or startup hubs, redefining what "downtown" means when work is no longer anchored to cubicles.


The passage primarily


A) argues that commuting should be banned


B) examines how remote work is changing workers' expectations and city planning


C) proves that all jobs will become remote


D) compares salaries in different cities


The chart description in the passage mainly supports the idea that


A) remote workers work fewer hours


B) commute times vary significantly depending on work arrangement


C) public transit is unreliable


D) all workers dislike cities


Based on the described bar graph, which group has the longest average one-way commute?


A) Fully in-office workers


B) Hybrid workers


C) Fully remote workers


D) All three are the same


In line with the passage, shorter commute times are associated with


A) increased stress and worse sleep


B) lower civic engagement


C) better sleep quality and potentially more civic engagement


D) higher housing costs


The conversion of empty office towers into apartments and schools is presented as


A) evidence that cities are failing


B) an example of how cities may creatively adapt to remote work


C) a temporary trend that will soon reverse


D) a policy that workers oppose


The author's attitude toward remote work can best be described as


A) cautiously analytical, noting both opportunities and challenges


B) entirely negative, focusing on economic collapse


C) purely celebratory, ignoring drawbacks


D) indifferent and uninterested


Questions 13–18: Natural Science Passage


Coral Reefs on the Edge


Coral reefs occupy less than 1% of the ocean floor yet support an estimated 25% of marine species. Their intricate structures provide shelter, breeding grounds, and feeding sites. However, reefs worldwide are bleaching—turning ghostly white—as ocean temperatures rise.


Corals live in partnership with microscopic algae that perform photosynthesis and share nutrients. When water temperatures become too warm, corals expel these algae, losing both color and a primary food source. If stressful conditions persist, corals starve and die.


Bleaching events are becoming more frequent. A reef that used to experience severe bleaching once every few decades may now face it every few years. This leaves little time for recovery. Overfishing, pollution, and coastal development compound the problem by weakening reef resilience.


Yet some hope remains. Researchers have identified "super corals"—individuals that tolerate higher temperatures. Restoration projects transplant these corals to vulnerable reefs, attempting to spread resilient genes. Others experiment with shade structures or localized cooling techniques, trying to protect patches of reef during heatwaves.


Ultimately, though, local fixes cannot fully offset global warming. Without significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, restoration efforts will be like patching holes in a ship that continues to sink.


The passage primarily


A) explains coral reproduction strategies


B) describes coral bleaching causes and partial solutions, emphasizing climate change as the core issue


C) argues fishing should be banned


D) compares coral reefs to rainforests in detail


The relationship between corals and microscopic algae is best described as


A) competitive


B) parasitic


C) mutually beneficial, with algae providing nutrients via photosynthesis


D) irrelevant to coral health


A key reason bleaching is more dangerous now than in the past is that


A) corals have stopped reproducing


B) bleaching events happen more often, leaving less time for reefs to recover


C) algae no longer perform photosynthesis


D) predators eat all bleached corals immediately


The mention of "super corals" serves mainly to


A) show that all reefs are fully safe


B) provide an example of adaptation and targeted restoration strategies


C) argue that climate change is no longer a threat


D) explain why overfishing is beneficial


The metaphor about "patching holes in a ship that continues to sink" suggests that


A) restoration efforts are completely useless


B) restoration helps, but without addressing climate change, reefs remain at serious risk


C) local projects are more important than global policy


D) scientists should stop studying reefs


Which of the following best captures the author's view of reef restoration?


A) It's unnecessary because reefs will recover on their own.


B) It's somewhat helpful but ultimately limited unless emissions are reduced.


C) It's more important than reducing greenhouse gas emissions.


D) It is already sufficient to solve the bleaching problem.


Questions 19–24: Humanities Passage


Translating Poetry


Translating a poem is less like copying a painting and more like performing a piece of music. Two violinists playing the same composition will produce different interpretations—both valid, neither definitive. Similarly, no translation can capture every nuance of the original text.


Languages carve reality into different shapes. A single Japanese word may require a whole English sentence. A Spanish phrase might carry cultural associations that no direct English equivalent can convey. Rhyme schemes that sound natural in one language may seem forced in another.


Consequently, translators make choices. Should they preserve the original rhyme at the cost of some meaning? Or favor precise meaning, even if the poem loses its musicality? Some create multiple translations: one literal, one more poetic.


Readers often ask, "Which translation is best?" That question misunderstands the art. The better question is, "What does this translation help me notice?" A good translation is not a perfect mirror but a carefully crafted lens, revealing aspects of the original that might otherwise remain invisible.


The passage primarily discusses


A) why poetry should not be translated


B) challenges and artistic choices involved in translating poetry


C) how to learn foreign languages quickly


D) the history of Japanese and Spanish literature


The comparison between translation and musical performance suggests that


A) translations should always be sung


B) different translations can be valid interpretations, not exact replicas


C) musical training is required for translators


D) only one translation can be correct


The passage implies that rhyme schemes


A) are identical across languages


B) are unimportant in poetry


C) may be difficult to preserve naturally when translating between languages


D) should never be changed


The question "Which translation is best?" is criticized because it


A) discourages learning original languages


B) assumes a single perfect translation exists


C) suggests translators are unskilled


D) implies that poetry is unimportant


As used in the final sentence, describing translation as a "lens" emphasizes


A) distortion and inaccuracy


B) the idea that translations shape what readers notice and understand


C) the scientific nature of translation


D) the importance of visual art


The author would most likely agree that a "good" translation


A) must preserve every rhyme and rhythm exactly


B) is impossible to create


C) helps readers perceive meaningful aspects of the original, even if some elements change


D) requires no interpretation


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Universal Basic Income (UBI)


Passage 1


Proposals for a universal basic income—a guaranteed cash payment to every adult citizen—respond to economic instability and automation. As jobs become less predictable, tying survival to employment alone seems increasingly risky.


Supporters argue that UBI simplifies welfare systems. Instead of complex eligibility requirements and stigma around assistance, everyone receives the same amount. This baseline security could empower people to refuse exploitative work, start businesses, or pursue education.


Experiments in several countries show promising results. Recipients report reduced stress, improved mental health, and greater ability to plan. Contrary to fears, most do not stop working entirely; instead, they shift from unstable gig work to more sustainable paths.


Passage 2


Universal basic income proposals misunderstand both work and dignity. While economic security is important, providing income without expectations risks eroding social bonds built around contribution.


Work is more than a paycheck. It structures time, builds skills, and creates community. If income is guaranteed regardless of effort, some people may disengage from collective responsibilities. Over time, resentment could grow among those who continue working in demanding jobs.


Targeted welfare programs, though imperfect, prioritize those truly in need and maintain a connection between work and reward. Rather than distributing cash universally, societies should invest in job training, childcare, and healthcare—supports that enable participation in meaningful work.


Both passages would likely agree that


A) economic security is important


B) people should receive money without any conditions


C) UBI has been widely implemented everywhere


D) work has no value beyond income


Passage 1 emphasizes that UBI


A) replaces all forms of work


B) might reduce stigma and complexity in welfare systems


C) guarantees people will stop working


D) has never been tested


Passage 2's main concern about UBI is that it


A) costs too little to matter


B) undermines social bonds and the connection between contribution and support


C) increases job training opportunities


D) requires too many eligibility rules


How would Passage 2 likely respond to the experiments mentioned in Passage 1?


A) Accept them as definitive proof UBI has no downsides


B) Argue that short-term experiments may not reveal long-term cultural effects


C) Claim the experiments did not involve real money


D) Ignore them as irrelevant


Passage 1 would most likely respond to the worry about people disengaging from work by pointing out that


A) work is unnecessary


B) in existing trials, most recipients continued working or made more sustainable choices


C) no one values work anyway


D) all welfare programs have the same problem


The relationship between the passages is best described as


A) presenting identical arguments for UBI


B) Passage 1 supporting UBI while Passage 2 raises concerns and favors alternatives


C) both rejecting UBI completely


D) both focusing only on the technical details of welfare administration
