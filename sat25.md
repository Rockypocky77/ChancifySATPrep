SAT PRACTICE TEST 25





SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


Secondhand Piano


The piano arrived on a rainy Tuesday, its wood dulled and keys yellowed like old teeth. Dad bought it from a neighbor who was moving away, insisting it was "a bargain we couldn't pass up," though money was tight enough that every bargain felt suspicious.


We had no musicians in the family. The closest we came was Mom humming half-remembered lullabies while stirring soup. Yet Dad pushed the piano against the living room wall like it had always belonged there and announced, "Someone in this house is going to learn."


He meant me.


At first, I hated it. The keys clacked unevenly; a few didn't sound at all. The bench wobbled. While my friends scrolled through videos after school, I plodded through beginner exercises about dancing bears and silver bells. My left hand lagged behind my right, as if it hadn't gotten the memo.


But slowly, something shifted. The same patterns that once bored me started to feel like codes I could finally crack. When I played, the rest of the house settled—my brother's video games paused, the television muted. Even Dad, usually restless, would sit still and listen, his eyes half-closed like he was trying to remember something.


One evening, I stumbled through a simple version of "Claire de Lune." It was clumsy, full of stops and false starts, but when I finished, Mom's eyes were wet.


"I used to play that in college," she said quietly. "I stopped when things got…busy."


I looked at the piano, suddenly aware that it carried more than chipped varnish and rusty strings. It carried the weight of choices my parents had made, the lives they might have lived. When I sat on that wobbly bench, it felt like I was balancing on the narrow space between their unfinished songs and my own.

Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


Remote Work and the Geography of Jobs


For most of the twentieth century, career success required physical relocation. Ambitious workers moved toward opportunity—often from rural towns to urban centers. But remote work is reshaping that geography.


A recent survey asked employees where they would live if location had no effect on salary or job opportunities. The results can be described as follows:


20% chose a major city center,


35% chose a suburb near a city,


30% chose a small town, and


15% chose a rural area.


This distribution contrasts sharply with current population patterns, where major city centers still dominate high-paying job markets. Remote work, if widely adopted, could gradually align where people want to live with where they can work.


However, benefits are uneven. Highly educated workers in technology, finance, and professional services are far more likely to access remote options than retail employees or nurses. Without policy intervention, remote work might deepen inequalities—granting flexibility and lower living costs to already advantaged workers.


Local governments face new challenges. Cities worry about reduced tax revenue if high-income workers move away. Smaller towns and rural areas must prepare for potential population influx: expanded broadband, housing, and infrastructure. The geography of opportunity is no longer fixed, but its new shape remains uncertain.


The passage primarily


A) describes the history of internet development


B) examines how remote work may change where people live and work


C) argues everyone will move to rural areas


D) explains why cities will disappear


The survey results suggest that if job location didn't matter,


A) most people would still choose dense city centers


B) more people would choose suburbs and small towns than major city centers


C) rural areas would be abandoned


D) suburbs would be the least popular option


The contrast between survey preferences and current population patterns mainly highlights


A) random migration


B) that people's preferred locations differ from where high-paying jobs are currently concentrated


C) the decline of suburbs


D) the failure of rural communities


The passage implies that remote work opportunities


A) are distributed equally across all professions


B) primarily benefit workers in fields that can be done digitally


C) are most common in retail jobs


D) mostly help rural farmers


Local governments in small towns and rural areas mainly need to


A) discourage new residents


B) invest in infrastructure to handle possible growth


C) close schools and hospitals


D) ban remote work


The tone of the passage toward remote work's future is best described as


A) certain and optimistic


B) dismissive and critical


C) cautiously analytical and uncertain


D) nostalgic and emotional


Questions 13–18: Natural Science Passage


The Hidden Life of Lichens


Lichens, the crusty patches on rocks and tree bark, rarely receive attention. Yet these humble organisms are among the most remarkable partnerships in nature. A lichen isn't a single organism but a collaboration—primarily between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium.


The fungus provides structure and protection, creating a tiny fortress that traps moisture and shields against intense sunlight. Inside this shelter, the photosynthetic partner produces sugars using sunlight, sharing them with the fungus. For decades, scientists described this as a simple two-part symbiosis.


Recent research complicates the story. DNA analyses reveal additional microbial partners—yeasts and bacteria—living within lichens. These hidden members may influence color, resilience, and growth rates. What once seemed like a duet is more accurately an entire choir of species cooperating.


Lichens colonize extreme environments: Arctic tundra, bare rock, even city rooftops. They slowly break down rock into soil, making ecosystems possible where none existed. Because they absorb water and nutrients directly from the air, they are especially sensitive to pollution. When lichens disappear from an area, it often signals declining air quality.


The passage primarily


A) argues lichens are agricultural pests


B) explains lichen structure and ecological importance


C) describes how to grow lichens indoors


D) compares lichens to animals


The relationship between the fungus and the photosynthetic partner is best described as


A) competitive, with each trying to dominate


B) parasitic, where the fungus harms the alga


C) mutually beneficial, with shelter exchanged for sugars


D) irrelevant to lichen survival


The recent discovery of additional microbial partners suggests that lichens


A) are less complex than previously thought


B) may involve multiple species interacting in subtle ways


C) cannot survive in cities


D) no longer exist in polluted areas


The metaphor "what once seemed like a duet is more accurately an entire choir" emphasizes that


A) lichens are noisy


B) many species participate in the lichen partnership


C) lichens produce music-like vibrations


D) scientists dislike simple explanations


Lichens are useful indicators of air quality because they


A) grow fastest in polluted areas


B) rely on complex root systems


C) absorb substances directly from the air and are sensitive to pollutants


D) live only on trees


The passage implies that lichen colonization of bare rock


A) prevents any other organisms from growing


B) creates conditions that eventually support other life forms


C) destroys existing ecosystems


D) accelerates pollution


Questions 19–24: Humanities Passage


The Public Library's Quiet Revolution


When people imagine innovation, they picture sleek startups or cutting-edge labs—not buildings filled with shelves and silence. Yet public libraries are quietly reinventing themselves for the digital age.


Traditional services remain: borrowing books, offering quiet study spaces, providing story time for children. But many libraries now loan laptops and Wi-Fi hotspots, host coding workshops, and provide 3D printers or recording studios. A person experiencing homelessness might charge a phone and apply for jobs. A teenager might learn video editing on public computers. A retiree might attend a workshop on avoiding online scams.


This transformation reframes libraries as access hubs rather than simple book warehouses. They level the digital playing field, especially for patrons who can't afford broadband or devices. Still, budgets often shrink just as communities demand more services. Librarians juggle roles—educator, social worker, tech guide—often without corresponding pay or training.


Whether cities recognize it or not, the twenty-first-century library has become one of the last truly public spaces: a place where anyone may enter, sit without buying anything, and ask questions without being treated as a nuisance.


The passage primarily emphasizes


A) declining interest in reading


B) how public libraries are expanding their roles in the digital era


C) the architectural design of libraries


D) why libraries should charge admission fees


The description of laptops, Wi-Fi hotspots, and 3D printers mainly serves to show that libraries


A) are abandoning books altogether


B) now function as technology and access centers


C) cater only to young people


D) are becoming private offices


The phrase "access hubs rather than simple book warehouses" suggests that libraries


A) no longer value physical books


B) focus only on entertainment


C) provide broader resources and services beyond traditional collections


D) should restrict entrance


The mention of librarians acting as "educator, social worker, tech guide" highlights


A) an unnecessary expansion of responsibilities


B) the growing complexity and demands of their jobs


C) that librarians no longer organize books


D) declining professionalism


The passage suggests that shrinking budgets


A) make it impossible for libraries to operate


B) reduce the number of librarians but not services


C) clash with communities' increasing expectations


D) are unrelated to library functions


The phrase "one of the last truly public spaces" implies that


A) most spaces now require payment or purchase


B) libraries should limit access


C) parks are closing


D) governments plan to privatize all buildings


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Urban Trees


Passage 1


Urban planners used to treat trees as decorative extras—pleasant but nonessential. Today, research reveals that city trees function more like infrastructure. Their benefits can be described numerically: in one mid-sized city, a study estimated that its urban forest removes 500 tons of air pollutants annually, stores 200,000 tons of carbon, and saves residents $3 million in energy costs by shading buildings.


These numbers underscore a broader point: trees perform work. They cool neighborhoods, reduce stormwater runoff by absorbing rainfall, and muffle traffic noise. Access to tree-lined streets correlates with lower rates of respiratory illness and heat-related hospital visits.


Yet urban canopy cover is unevenly distributed. Wealthier neighborhoods boast mature trees; low-income areas endure "heat islands" with little shade. As climate change intensifies heat waves, equitable tree planting becomes a public health priority, not mere beautification.


Passage 2


Despite their benefits, urban trees are surprisingly vulnerable. Root systems struggle in compacted soil surrounded by concrete. Branches tangle with power lines; trunks suffer from vehicles, lawn equipment, and vandalism. Municipal budgets often fund tree planting but neglect the slow, unglamorous work of long-term maintenance.


Critics argue that trees create hazards—falling limbs, clogged drains, and damaged sidewalks. When budgets tighten, officials may favor short-term savings by cutting down mature trees rather than investing in pruning and soil care. Ironically, this undermines the very cost savings trees provide through energy reduction and stormwater management.


Healthy urban forests require strategic planning: selecting species suited to local climates, designing root-friendly sidewalks, and funding arborist staff. Otherwise, cities risk treating trees as disposable decorations instead of living infrastructure requiring care.


Both passages would agree that urban trees


A) are primarily decorative


B) can provide significant practical benefits to cities


C) should be removed to save money


D) inevitably damage sidewalks


Passage 1 emphasizes


A) numerical evidence of trees' environmental and health benefits


B) the dangers of tree limbs


C) why cities should avoid planting trees in poor areas


D) that trees mostly cause allergies


Passage 2's main concern is that


A) cities plant too many trees


B) maintenance and planning are often neglected, threatening urban forests


C) tree species are all identical


D) maintenance is unnecessary


How would Passage 1 likely respond to complaints about trees clogging drains and damaging sidewalks (Passage 2)?


A) Agree that trees' costs outweigh any benefits


B) Argue that, despite some problems, overall environmental and health benefits justify careful investment


C) Suggest banning trees near buildings


D) Recommend replacing all trees with artificial shade structures


Unlike Passage 1, Passage 2 focuses more on


A) quantitative pollution removal data


B) social inequality in canopy cover


C) the challenges and costs of maintaining urban trees


D) the impact of trees on respiratory health


Together, the passages suggest that cities should


A) avoid planting trees in dense areas


B) invest in both planting and long-term care to maximize trees' infrastructure value


C) rely on volunteers to manage all urban trees


D) plant only in wealthy neighborhoods
