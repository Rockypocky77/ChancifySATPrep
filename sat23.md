SAT PRACTICE TEST 23


SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)


Questions 1–6: Literature Passage


The Sketchbook


When my wrist finally healed, the doctor said I could play the violin again "as long as I took it slowly." I nodded, but the words landed with less relief than he expected. For months, I had walked past my case without opening it, pretending I didn't notice the thin layer of dust on the latches.


Before the fracture, every afternoon had been measured in scales and etudes. I chased perfect intonation the way runners chase personal records, convinced that one more hour of practice would earn me a place in the youth orchestra's first violin section. When the audition list came out, my name appeared in smaller letters, in the middle of the second violin column.


I told everyone I was "fine" with the result. Two days later, I slipped on the front steps in the rain, reached out to catch myself, and heard the unmistakable crack. The doctor called it "unfortunate timing." Secretly, I wasn't sure. Part of me wondered if the universe had grown tired of my obsession and simply pulled the emergency brake.


During the weeks in the cast, I still needed something to do with my hands. On a whim, I bought a cheap sketchbook and a set of pencils from the pharmacy. My first drawings were stiff and awkward: lopsided coffee mugs, tilted chairs, my own face in the mirror with one eye always slightly higher than the other. No one was grading them. No panel of judges waited with raised eyebrows.


Slowly, the pages began to fill with scenes from the bus, from the lunchroom, from the alley behind our building where the stray cat slept on warm car hoods. I shaded the tired crease in the barista's forehead and the way my brother's shoulders curled when he laughed. For the first time, I wasn't trying to be perfect; I was trying to be honest.


"So," my mother asked when the cast came off, "when will you start practicing again?"


I looked at the violin case, then at the sketchbook lying open on my desk, the last drawing still unfinished. "Soon," I said. Then I picked up my pencil and began to work on the shadows in the corner of the page.


The passage primarily explores the narrator's


A) shift away from creative pursuits after losing interest in music and exploring alternative forms of expression.


B) effort to keep an injury secret from family members and friends, actively concealing information about their physical condition.


C) transition from striving for flawless technical execution in musical performance to discovering genuine self-expression through visual art creation.


D) accomplishment of gaining membership in a highly selective youth orchestra and achieving recognition for musical talent and skill.


Which sentence best supports the answer to Question 1?


A) "Before the fracture, every afternoon had been measured in scales and etudes."


B) "The doctor called it 'unfortunate timing.'"


C) "My first drawings were stiff and awkward…"


D) "For the first time, I wasn't trying to be perfect; I was trying to be honest."


The narrator's attitude toward the wrist injury is best described as


A) primarily negative and bitter, viewing it as a significant setback to musical aspirations and professional objectives.


B) ambivalent and complex, perceiving it simultaneously as a frustrating obstacle and an unanticipated liberation from intense performance expectations.


C) apathetic and unconcerned, because the narrator lacked genuine investment in violin playing from the beginning.


D) lighthearted and humorous, treating the injury as an amusing incident without serious consequences.


In context, the phrase "pulled the emergency brake" (paragraph 3) most nearly suggests that


A) the narrator literally stopped a moving car.


B) the narrator's life was suddenly forced to slow down or change direction.


C) the doctor prevented the narrator from returning to school.


D) the youth orchestra canceled its auditions.


The description of the sketchbook drawings (paragraph 4 and 5) mainly emphasizes


A) the narrator's frustration with visual art.


B) the narrator's desire to impress professional artists.


C) the freedom of creating without external judgment.


D) the narrator's plan to sell the drawings.


The final sentence ("Then I picked up my pencil and began to work on the shadows…") suggests that the narrator


A) has largely abandoned the violin in favor of drawing.


B) intends to ignore the doctor's advice.


C) is choosing, at least for now, to continue exploring drawing.


D) has no interest in either art or music.


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage


Group Projects and Responsibility


Teachers often assign group projects to encourage collaboration, but students frequently complain that the work is not divided fairly. In many groups, one or two members take on the bulk of the tasks, while others contribute little yet receive the same grade. This pattern can create resentment and discourage responsible students from participating enthusiastically.


Research on "social loafing" helps explain this behavior. Psychologists use the term to describe the tendency for individuals to put in less effort when they believe their contribution cannot be easily identified. If a grade is shared by the whole group, a student may assume that others will compensate for their lack of effort.


Some instructors attempt to solve this problem by incorporating peer evaluations into group grades. When students know their teammates will rate their participation, they may feel more accountable. However, peer evaluations can introduce new complications, such as friendship bias or fear of conflict.


A more comprehensive approach might involve clearly defined roles, regular check-ins, and a grading structure that combines group outcomes with individual reflections. Such designs ask students not only to work together but also to think critically about how they collaborate.


The passage primarily


A) argues that group projects should generally be avoided in most educational contexts.


B) examines why group projects can feel unfair and suggests ways to improve them.


C) describes how to choose friends for group work.


D) explains why teachers prefer lecture over group activities.


According to the passage, "social loafing" occurs when


A) group members are paid for their work.


B) someone's effort is praised publicly.


C) individuals put in less effort if their personal contribution is hard to identify.


D) groups meet too frequently.


The passage suggests that one problem with peer evaluations is that they


A) tend to be inaccurate in most cases.


B) guarantee unfair grades.


C) can be influenced by friendships or fear of confrontation.


D) eliminate the need for teacher involvement.


Which idea is emphasized in the final paragraph?


A) Group projects should count for most of a student's grade.


B) Students should be allowed to choose any role they want.


C) Teachers should ignore group dynamics.


D) Effective group project design includes both structure and individual accountability.


The word "comprehensive" in the final paragraph most nearly means


A) incomplete.


B) thorough and covering multiple aspects.


C) simple and easy to implement.


D) related only to grades.


The passage implies that when students feel personally accountable, they are


A) less likely to participate.


B) more likely to contribute consistently.


C) likely to receive higher grades in most cases.


D) forced into leadership roles.


Questions 13–20: Natural Science Passage with Data


Algae Growth and Light Intensity


A biology student investigated how light intensity affected the growth of green algae in a lab setting. The student prepared four identical glass flasks, each containing the same volume of nutrient solution and the same initial amount of algae. The only difference between the flasks was the brightness of the lamp placed next to each one.


The light levels were set as follows:


 • Flask A: low light (25% of maximum brightness)


 • Flask B: medium light (50% of maximum brightness)


 • Flask C: high light (75% of maximum brightness)


 • Flask D: very high light (100% of maximum brightness)


After seven days, the student measured the mass of algae in each flask. The results were:


 • Flask A: 3 grams


 • Flask B: 5 grams (corrected)


 • Flask C: 9 grams


 • Flask D: 8 grams


Based on these data, the student concluded that increasing light intensity generally boosted algae growth, but that extremely high light slightly reduced growth compared with high light.


The main purpose of the passage is to


A) describe an experiment testing how light intensity affects algae growth.


B) compare algae with other aquatic organisms.


C) argue that algae should not be used in labs.


D) explain the structure of a glass flask.


Between which two flasks is the largest increase in algae mass observed as light intensity increases step by step from A to D? (clarified & made unique)


A) Flask A and Flask B


B) Flask B and Flask C


C) Flask C and Flask D


D) Flask A and Flask D


Compared with Flask C, Flask D


A) has more algae growth.


B) has the same amount of algae growth.


C) has slightly less algae growth.


D) has no algae growth at all.


Which statement is best supported by the data?


A) Algae generally grow best in darkness.


B) Algae growth increases with light up to a point, then begins to decrease at very high light levels.


C) Light has no effect on algae growth.


D) Algae growth is identical at all four light levels.


On a graph with light intensity on the horizontal axis and algae mass on the vertical axis, what kind of pattern would the data most likely form?


A) A perfectly horizontal line


B) An increase from A to C, followed by a slight drop at D


C) A steady decrease from A to D


D) A circle


Which sentence from the passage directly states the student's conclusion?


A) "A biology student investigated how light intensity affected the growth of green algae…"


B) "The light levels were set as follows…"


C) "After seven days, the student measured the mass of algae in each flask."


D) "Based on these data, the student concluded that increasing light intensity generally boosted algae growth, but that extremely high light slightly reduced growth compared with high light."


If the student wanted to test even higher light levels, which prediction would best match the pattern in the data?


A) Algae growth would almost certainly double compared with Flask C.


B) Algae might decrease further due to stress from excessive light.


C) Light levels above 100% would have no effect.


D) The algae would immediately die in all flasks.


In this experiment, the independent variable is


A) the mass of algae after seven days.


B) the type of nutrient solution.


C) the light intensity near each flask.


D) the size of the flasks.


Questions 21–30: Paired Passages – Community Service Requirements


Passage 1


Some schools require students to complete a certain number of community service hours before graduation. Supporters of this policy argue that service requirements introduce students to local needs they might otherwise ignore. A teenager who volunteers at a food pantry or neighborhood cleanup may develop empathy and a sense of civic responsibility.


Mandatory service can also reduce barriers that prevent students from volunteering. If schools provide transportation, coordinate projects, and allow hours to be completed during school time, students who work after school or care for younger siblings still have an opportunity to participate. For many, a requirement becomes the first step toward a lifetime of community engagement.


Passage 2


Critics respond that "required" community service is not truly voluntary and may feel like a burden rather than a meaningful choice. When students are obligated to participate, some simply seek the easiest way to collect hours, focusing on paperwork instead of impact. This can strain organizations that must supervise volunteers who are only half-heartedly engaged.


Opponents also worry that a requirement sends the wrong message: that civic involvement is another box to check for a diploma or college application. They argue that schools should encourage service by offering appealing opportunities and recognition, not by adding another graduation condition.


Both passages would most likely agree that


A) schools play an important role in encouraging students to volunteer.


B) community service hours should generally not appear on college applications.


C) students are too busy to participate in any service.


D) community service harms local organizations.


Passage 1 emphasizes that a service requirement can


A) prevent students from learning about local needs.


B) make volunteering more accessible by removing practical obstacles.


C) guarantee that students will volunteer throughout their lives.


D) reduce the importance of classroom learning.


Passage 2 suggests that required community service may


A) generally be enjoyable for most students.


B) have no effect on organizations.


C) cause some students to treat service as a task to complete rather than a genuine commitment.


D) be impossible to track.


Which sentence from Passage 1 best supports the idea that structured programs can help busy students participate?


A) "Some schools require students to complete a certain number of community service hours before graduation."


B) "If schools provide transportation, coordinate projects, and allow hours to be completed during school time, students who work after school or care for younger siblings still have an opportunity to participate."


C) "A teenager who volunteers at a food pantry or neighborhood cleanup may develop empathy…"


D) "For many, a requirement becomes the first step toward a lifetime of community engagement."


Which sentence from Passage 2 highlights a potential burden on organizations?


A) "Critics respond that 'required' community service is not truly voluntary…"


B) "When students are obligated to participate…"


C) "This can strain organizations that must supervise volunteers who are only half-heartedly engaged."


D) "They argue that schools should encourage service by offering appealing opportunities…"


The relationship between the two passages is best described as


A) Passage 1 and Passage 2 both criticizing service requirements.


B) Passage 1 criticizing schools and Passage 2 defending them.


C) Passage 1 presenting arguments in favor of service requirements, while Passage 2 presents concerns about those requirements.


D) Passage 1 providing data and Passage 2 ignoring it.


According to Passage 2, one concern about mandatory service is that it


A) eliminates extracurricular activities.


B) encourages students to focus on accumulating hours instead of meaningful impact.


C) prevents students from applying to college.


D) reduces the number of available volunteer positions.


How would a supporter of Passage 1 most likely respond to the concern in Passage 2 that students may be "half-heartedly engaged"?


A) By agreeing that all requirements should be removed


B) By arguing that careful project selection and reflection activities can deepen engagement


C) By insisting that students' attitudes are unimportant


D) By proposing that service be replaced by tests


Both passages imply that the ideal outcome of any service program is that students


A) complete the minimum possible hours.


B) compete for awards based on hours recorded.


C) develop a genuine, lasting commitment to their communities.


D) avoid volunteering unless it is required.


Which question is most directly raised by both passages?


A) Should schools eliminate all graduation requirements?


B) How can schools encourage meaningful civic engagement among students?


C) What is the best way to grade community service?


D) Should colleges stop asking about extracurricular activities?
