SAT PRACTICE TEST 9

SECTION 1: READING & WRITING (54 Questions)

---

**Question 1**

When my brother left for college, he forgot his guitar. It leaned against the corner of our shared bedroom, the strap still twisted the way he wore it on stage. He texted me two days after move-in: "Did I leave my guitar? Can you ship it?" I thought about summers listening from the hallway while he practiced, never brave enough to ask him to teach me. That night I searched "basic guitar chords" and played until my fingers ached. For the first time, music in the house belonged partly to me.

The passage primarily explores the narrator's experience of

A) managing logistics and costs of shipping musical instruments
B) attempting to establish an independent identity after a sibling's departure
C) overcoming practical challenges of learning guitar without instruction
D) processing abandonment feelings after the brother's move to college

---

**Question 2**

I thought about the way our parents always called him "the talented one" and me "the responsible one," as if the categories were mutually exclusive. As if talent and responsibility couldn't coexist in the same person. The labels had been assigned early and never questioned—he was creative, artistic, musical; I was dependable, organized, sensible. Neither of us had chosen these roles, but both of us had learned to perform them.

The parents' description of the narrator as "the responsible one" most strongly implies that they

A) consider the narrator fundamentally unreliable in all circumstances
B) defined siblings by contrasting traits that limited each one's perceived potential
C) recognized equal musical talent in both children
D) encouraged the narrator to pursue artistic expression alongside the brother
B) perceive responsibility and creative talent as distinct, mutually exclusive qualities
C) expect the narrator to pursue musical training alongside the brother and parallel development
D) consider both siblings equally talented in different artistic domains and creative pursuits

3. The narrator delays shipping the guitar primarily because the narrator

A) lacks access to shipping services in the local area and transportation options
B) has been explicitly forbidden by the parents to send it and prohibited from doing so
C) wants an opportunity to learn and develop a personal connection to music
D) discovered the instrument was damaged and requires repair before shipping

4. The line "It wasn't a lie. I just didn't say how soon" suggests that the narrator feels

A) profoundly dishonest about the deception and morally compromised by lying
B) justified in temporarily keeping the guitar while technically telling the truth
C) sufficiently guilty to ship the guitar immediately afterward and resolve the situation
D) completely indifferent to the brother's musical needs and personal requirements

5. Throughout the passage, the guitar most plausibly functions as a symbol of

A) evidence of the brother's carelessness and forgetfulness and irresponsible behavior
B) a reminder of the parents' overly strict household rules and restrictive policies
C) an opportunity for the narrator to explore a previously inaccessible identity
D) a purely decorative object with no meaningful significance or personal value

6. The overall tone of the passage is best characterized as

A) playfully sarcastic with elements of mockery
B) bitterly accusatory toward family members
C) quietly yearning with tentative hopefulness
D) emotionally detached and clinically objective


Questions 7–12: Social Science Passage

Remote Work, Real Tradeoffs

Before 2020, fewer than 10% of full-time employees in a certain survey worked primarily from home. By 2022, that number rose to 35%. Companies celebrated reduced office costs; employees praised flexibility. But the data tell a more complicated story.

A research firm followed three departments at the same company over a year. Team A worked entirely in-office. Team B used a hybrid schedule (3 days in office, 2 remote). Team C was fully remote. The firm recorded average weekly hours worked and self-reported productivity (on a 1–10 scale):

Team A: 40 hours; productivity 7.2
Team B: 41 hours; productivity 8.1
Team C: 43 hours; productivity 7.4

Hybrid workers reported the highest productivity and job satisfaction. Fully remote workers logged the most hours yet described more "digital exhaustion"—back-to-back video calls and blurred boundaries between work and home. In-office workers had clearer boundaries but less schedule control.

Managers worried about mentoring. Informal hallway conversations rarely happened on video platforms. New employees in Team C reported slower integration and weaker sense of belonging.

The study doesn't declare a single "best" model. Instead, it suggests tradeoffs: flexibility versus boundaries, autonomy versus connection. The challenge for organizations is designing systems that protect both productivity and people.

7. The passage primarily

A) argues that all employees should be required to return to full-time office work
B) describes the tradeoffs among in-office, hybrid, and fully remote work arrangements
C) demonstrates that remote work invariably reduces employee productivity
D) provides detailed instructions for setting up an effective home office environment

8. According to the data presented in the passage, which team reported the highest productivity score?

A) Team A (in-office)
B) Team B (hybrid)
C) Team C (remote)
D) All three teams reported equivalent productivity scores

9. The finding that Team C worked the most hours but did not report the highest productivity most strongly supports which inference?

A) Longer working hours consistently guarantee superior results
B) Remote workers are inherently less motivated than office workers
C) Additional time spent working does not necessarily translate into higher perceived productivity
D) Remote positions are fundamentally easier than office-based jobs

10. As used in the passage, the phrase "blurred boundaries" in the context of Team C most nearly refers to

A) unclear job titles and professional responsibilities
B) insufficient separation between work activities and personal life
C) confusion about company policies and procedures
D) complications arising from international time zone differences

11. The author's mention of "informal hallway conversations" (paragraph 5) primarily serves to

A) criticize unproductive office gossip among employees
B) illustrate a type of spontaneous interaction that is difficult to replicate through digital platforms
C) prove that remote workers never communicate with their colleagues
D) argue that all scheduled meetings should be eliminated

12. The author's overall perspective on remote work can best be described as

A) unreservedly enthusiastic about its benefits
B) cautiously balanced, acknowledging both advantages and drawbacks
C) entirely negative and critical of the practice
D) indifferent and largely uninterested in the topic


Questions 13–18: Natural Science Passage

Silent Rivers in Ice

Glaciers once seemed eternal—monolithic rivers of ice creeping so slowly that a human lifetime barely registered their motion. Today, many glaciers are shrinking visibly within a single decade.

Glacial mass balance depends on two forces: accumulation (mostly snowfall) and ablation (melting, sublimation, iceberg calving). In a stable glacier, these roughly match. Recent measurements show the balance tipping. Warmer air increases melt at the surface; warmer oceans erode glaciers from below where they meet the sea.

As ice melts, meltwater carves tunnels within glaciers, rushing through blue corridors like hidden rivers. This water lubricates the boundary between ice and bedrock, allowing glaciers to slide faster toward the ocean—speeding their own destruction.

The consequences extend far beyond picturesque mountains. Glaciers store about 69% of the world's freshwater. Their melt contributes to sea-level rise, threatening coastal communities. Regions that rely on predictable meltwater for agriculture face a paradox: first too much water as glaciers shrink rapidly, then too little once they disappear.

Scientists emphasize that glacial loss is not just a symbol of climate change; it is a mechanism that accelerates it. Bright ice reflects sunlight. Darker exposed rock and water absorb more heat, amplifying warming in a feedback loop.

13. The primary purpose of the passage is to

A) describe recreational activities available on glacial formations
B) explain the mechanisms of glacial decline and its broader environmental significance
C) argue that glaciers will fully recover within the coming decades
D) provide technical instructions for measuring glacier movement speed

14. As used in the passage, "glacial mass balance" (paragraph 2) refers to

A) the weight of individual ice crystals within the glacier
B) the relationship between ice accumulated and ice lost over time
C) the balance of animal populations living on glacial surfaces
D) a methodology for weighing mountain formations

15. According to the passage, underground meltwater rivers primarily

A) stabilize glaciers by providing structural support
B) slow glacier movement by increasing friction
C) lubricate the glacier base, accelerating movement toward the ocean
D) refreeze immediately upon contact with bedrock

16. The "paradox" described in paragraph 4 refers to the fact that some agricultural regions will

A) receive both snow and rain simultaneously
B) initially experience excessive water from rapid melting followed by water scarcity after glaciers disappear
C) never notice any changes in their water supply
D) be forced to abandon farming entirely regardless of water availability

17. The feedback loop described in the final paragraph occurs because

A) glaciers naturally move in uphill directions
B) exposed darker surfaces absorb more solar heat, increasing warming and accelerating further ice loss
C) ice consistently reflects less sunlight than exposed rock
D) ocean salinity increases as freshwater enters the sea

18. The overall tone of the passage is best characterized as

A) alarmed while maintaining scientific objectivity
B) humorous and deliberately casual
C) nostalgically romantic about past glacial conditions
D) hostile toward climate scientists and their research


Questions 19–24: Humanities Passage

More Than Quiet Buildings

Public libraries are often imagined as quiet warehouses for printed books, but their functions have always been broader. Early American libraries mixed moral instruction with civic education, hoping that informed citizens would sustain democracy.

Today's libraries still lend books, but they also lend Wi-Fi hotspots, sewing machines, telescopes, and laptops. They host job-search workshops, legal clinics, language classes, and vaccination drives. During heat waves, they become cooling centers; during crises, information hubs.

Ironically, the digital revolution that was supposed to make libraries obsolete has made them more necessary. Access to the internet is not evenly distributed. For people without broadband or devices, a library is less a "nice extra" and more a lifeline.

Critics sometimes argue that if everything is online, physical libraries are redundant. Librarians counter that "online" is not a neutral space. Search engines prioritize some voices over others; misinformation spreads easily. Libraries provide not just access to information but guidance in evaluating it.

The modern library is less a warehouse and more an infrastructure: a publicly funded system that turns "information in theory" into "knowledge people can actually use."

19. The passage primarily emphasizes

A) the architectural styles characteristic of library buildings
B) how libraries' roles have expanded significantly beyond traditional book storage
C) reasons why communities should reduce library funding
D) the historical development of internet search companies

20. The phrase "quiet warehouses for printed books" (paragraph 1) is used primarily to

A) praise libraries for their organizational efficiency
B) criticize the competence of library staff
C) present a limited stereotype that the author subsequently challenges
D) argue that libraries should maintain strict silence requirements

21. The passage suggests that for many community members, internet access

A) is universally guaranteed through home connections
B) makes physical libraries entirely unnecessary
C) remains unequally distributed, making libraries essential access points
D) is inherently dangerous and should be avoided

22. The author's discussion of search engines and misinformation (paragraph 4) primarily serves to demonstrate that

A) all online sources should be considered completely untrustworthy
B) librarians exercise inappropriate control over information access
C) digital spaces involve biases and confusion that libraries help users navigate
D) people should completely avoid using social media platforms

23. The line "less a warehouse and more an infrastructure" (final paragraph) suggests that modern libraries are

A) primarily passive storage facilities for books
B) active systems supporting diverse community needs
C) privately owned commercial enterprises
D) exclusively digital platforms without physical presence

24. The author's view of public libraries can best be characterized as

A) dismissive of their contemporary relevance
B) strongly supportive of their evolving community role
C) neutral and emotionally detached
D) skeptical about their effectiveness and value


Questions 25–30: Paired Passages – Phones in School

Passage 1

Allowing phones in classrooms may seem like inviting distraction, but banning them entirely misses an opportunity. When guided well, students can treat phones as tools rather than toys.

Consider research projects. A student group investigating local air quality can photograph traffic patterns, record short interviews, and input data into shared spreadsheets—all from a device in their pocket. Translation apps help multilingual students participate more fully. Accessibility features like screen readers and enlarged text support students with visual impairments.

The key is structure. Clear norms—phones face-down during discussion, used only for specific tasks—teach self-regulation. Pretending phones don't exist simply pushes use into hiding: under desks, in hallways, on the bus. Schools should model healthy technology habits rather than enforcing unrealistic abstinence.

Passage 2

Phones in classrooms are Trojan horses. They roll in under the banner of "digital learning tools" and then spill out notifications, games, and social media that fracture attention.

Teachers already battle for focus against endless entertainment. Even with rules, one buzzing phone can derail a lesson. Not all students have equal devices or data plans, turning "phone-based learning" into another inequity. The assumption that every student can or should participate through a personal device ignores those realities.

Moreover, schools have limited authority over privacy and data practices of tech companies. Encouraging constant phone use invites corporations into the classroom. Instead, schools should provide shared, school-managed devices when necessary and keep personal phones out of academic spaces.

25. Both passages would most likely agree that

A) phones have the potential to create distractions in educational settings
B) every student has equal access to smartphone technology
C) phones should be completely banned from all aspects of society
D) teachers never incorporate any technology into classroom instruction

26. The central claim of Passage 1 is that

A) phones present no risks whatsoever in educational environments
B) phones should eventually replace human teachers entirely
C) with appropriate structure and guidelines, phones can serve as valuable learning tools
D) students should be permitted to establish all classroom policies independently

27. Passage 2's primary concern about phones in classrooms is that they

A) are too expensive for schools to purchase in sufficient quantities
B) inevitably improve student attention and engagement
C) introduce problems of distraction, inequity, and privacy into learning environments
D) make traditional textbooks completely obsolete

28. How would the author of Passage 2 most likely respond to Passage 1's argument that schools should "model healthy technology habits"?

A) By agreeing enthusiastically and recommending even more extensive phone use
B) By arguing that modeling healthy habits is impractical when phones constantly disrupt focused learning
C) By claiming that technology has no measurable effect on habit formation
D) By insisting that students already possess perfect self-control around devices

29. Unlike Passage 2, Passage 1 emphasizes

A) phone-based opportunities for research, accessibility, and learning
B) corporate control of student data and privacy
C) the necessity of keeping phones entirely out of schools
D) unequal access to devices among student populations

30. The relationship between the two passages is best characterized as

A) both supporting unrestricted phone use in all educational contexts
B) both opposing all forms of classroom technology integration
C) Passage 1 cautiously supporting structured phone use while Passage 2 warning strongly against allowing personal devices in class
D) Passage 2 providing a summary and elaboration of Passage 1's arguments
